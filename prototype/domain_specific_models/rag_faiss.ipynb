These are\\nderived either based on fundamental physical laws often combined with empirical\\nassumptions or learned based on data. The former has been existing for several\\ndecades in chemical and process engineering while the latter has recently\\nreceived a lot of attention with the emergence of several artiﬁcial intelligence/\\nmachine learning techniques. Hybrid modeling is an emerging modeling paradigm\\nthat explores the synergy between existing these two paradigms, taking advantage\\nof the existing process knowledge (or engineering know-how) and information\\ndisseminated by the collected data. Such an approach is especially suitable for\\nsystems and industries where data generation is signiﬁcantly resource intensive\\nwhile at the same time fundamentally not completely deciphered such as the\\nprocesses involved in the biopharmaceutical pipeline. This technology could, in\\nfact, be the enabler to meeting the demands and goals of several initiatives such as\\nQuality by design, Process Analytical tools, and Pharma 4.0. In addition, it can aid in\\ndifferent process applications throughout process development and Chemistry,\\nManufacturing, and Control (CMC) to make it more strategic and efﬁcient. This\\narticle focuses on providing a step-by-step guide to the different considerations to\\nbe made to develop a reliable and applicable hybrid model.

Some such modalities\\ninclude mRNA-based vaccines ( Sahin et al., 2014 ; Bhat et al.,\\n2021; Qin et al., 2022 ), cell and gene therapies, extracellular\\nvesicles (EVs) ( Murphy et al., 2019 ; Klyachko et al., 2020 ;\\nBertolino et al., 2022 ), and living materials ( Gilbert and Ellis,\\n2019; Rodrigo-Navarro et al., 2021 ), with the latter two still\\nunder development and have not reached the approval phase, yet\\n(Walsh and Walsh, 2022).\\nDespite the increasing market sizes and approvals (Walsh, 2018;\\nWalsh and Walsh, 2022), the development of such biologics is\\ntypically a slow and resource-intensive process taking up to\\n10–12 years and an investment of at least 2 billion USD\\n(Narayanan et al., 2021a ; Cardillo et al., 2021 ). Among these\\nestimated times and costs, process development accounts for a\\nsigniﬁcant portion taking up to 4 years (30% of the time to\\nmarket) and an average investment of ~100 million USD\\n(Cardillo et al., 2021) making it considerably resource-intensive,\\nhaving important consequences in drug manufacturing.\\nAdditionally, the challenges for process development increase\\nmanifold when considering biosimilars where the complexity of\\nmatching drug quality is high in addition to the high time pressure\\ndue to competition.\\nIn this regard, the key tasks associated with biopharmaceutical\\nprocess development and Chemistry Manufacturing and Control\\n(CMC) are: 1) Design and Optimization: To identify the suitable\\nprocess parameters to produce a product with the desired quantity\\nand quality attributes, 2) Scale-Up: To reproduce observations/\\nattributes achieved in lab scale operations and also at commercial\\nscale, 3) Monitoring and Control: Maintain the desired state/\\ntrajectory of the process. The different tasks in process\\ndevelopment and CMC with the progression of the\\nbiopharmaceutical lifecycle are schematically represented in\\nFigure 1with the corresponding indication of the relevant initiatives.\\nIn a highly multi-dimensional design space, where the\\ninteractions between the governi ng variables are complex, trial\\nand error-based or restricted operations enforce sub-optimality\\nand risk of not meeting quality speciﬁcations. In addition, it also\\nincreases the time and cost of development if such activities\\noriginate from an unfavorable region originating from an\\ninefﬁcient transfer of past learning. Currently, such transfers\\nare performed as heuristics or conclusions determined based on\\nobservations drawn from particular cases (Narayanan and Love,\\n2022). For instance, working in a narrow range of pH or\\ntemperature based on previous product lines or using speci ﬁc\\nbasal and feed media for all the products produced by a given\\nhost. Though the Quality by Design paradigm has come some\\nway to reuse knowledge, mostly in the form of technical risk\\nassessments, knowledge transfer is limited and despite the wide\\nspread of platform processes, to some degree, the process pipeline\\nneeds to be developed from scratch, at least in parts, for every new\\nmolecule.\\nThe increasing number of modalities and varieties within the\\nsame modality requires that the same development steps be\\nundertaken multiple times. A standardized workﬂow for carrying\\nout these steps is required to accelerate the pipeline while reducing\\nthe resources. What we envision through a standardized protocol is a\\nguideline to the series of steps to be undertaken for each new product\\nwith an unbiased, generalized transfer of learnings from one case to\\nanother.\\nAs a result, we require that all the data and learning acquired\\nunder a certain product are 1) strategically collected through\\nefﬁcient designs covering the design space, and 2) formalized via\\nrelevant mathematical modeling to capture the overall patterns in\\nthe data (Narayanan and Love, 2022). In addition to the goals of\\nprocess development, such formalization of information and\\nknowledge are inevitable in the digital era where all the process\\nindustries including biopharma are interested in digitalizing their\\noperation and production, moving towards digital twins and smart\\nfactories (Steinwandter et al., 2019; Narayanan et al., 2020b; Chen\\net al., 2020; Gargalo et al., 2020; Sokolov, 2020; Zobel-Roos et al.,\\n2020; Narayanan et al., 2021d).\\nFIGURE 1\\nSchematic representation of the key process development and CMC tasks throughout the biopharmaceutical lifecycle with an indication of the key\\ninitiatives and goals of biopharma and the regulatory agencies.\\nFrontiers in Chemical Engineering frontiersin.org02\\nNarayanan et al. 10.3389/fceng.2023.1157889\\n\\x0cTo this aim, artiﬁcial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) are\\nsuitable techniques to learn patterns in data collected from high-\\ndimensional design spaces with complex non-linear interactions\\namong different factors (Narayanan et al., 2021a). However, using\\nAI/ML solely requires good quality data to be collected in a\\nconsiderable quantity to be able to develop useful and applicable\\nmodels for the intended purposes of biopharmaceutical application.\\nIn contrast, biopharma is a data-limited industry speciﬁcally in\\nterms of actively generated data, where each experiment and\\nanalytics is resource-intensive, thus, limiting the number of\\nexperiments and the corresponding data that can be generated\\n(von Stosch et al., 2021 ). In addition, though the\\nbiopharmaceutical industry has a lot of reserves of the so-called\\n“historical data,” were not collected for the purpose of training an\\nAI/ML algorithm. Subsequently, they harbor a lot of bias in terms of\\nthe design spaces explored and the information recorded as a result\\naffecting the overall quality of the pre-existing data in the industry.\\nThese challenges have been described in depth in the following\\ncommentary article (Narayanan and Love, 2022).\\nHowever, data is not the only source of information available in\\nbiopharma. This is especially true for process applications where a\\nbasic understanding of the unit operations and some level of\\nabstraction regarding the physicochemical phenomena at a unit\\noperation level are available. However, this knowledge is not\\ncomplete or sufﬁcient to build a solely knowledge-based model.\\nHybrid modeling has recently found increasing interest as it\\nattains a balance between the purely data-based modeling offered by\\nAI/ML and purely knowledge-based modeling (mostly less\\nrepresentative given the existing gaps in understanding the\\nsystem). As a result, it presents remarkable qualities, detailed and\\nsummarized in Section 3, that make it suitable for all the process\\ngoals of the biopharmaceutical industry as highlighted in several\\nworks. For instance, (von Stosch et al., 2014; von Stosch et al., 2016),\\npresents hybrid modeling as a solution for QbD and PAT, (Schubert\\net al., 1994a; Galvanauskas et al., 2004; Teixeira et al., 2006), for\\nprocess optimization, (Bayer et al., 2021), for scale-up, (Schubert\\net al., 1994a; Chen et al., 2000; Galvanauskas et al., 2004; Teixeira\\net al., 2007; Ferreira et al., 2014; Narayanan et al., 2020a; Narayanan\\net al., 2020b), for process monitoring and control, (Sokolov, 2020;\\nNarayanan et al., 2021d), for digitalization, and (Sokolov et al., 2021)\\nfor digital twins.\\nThis article focuses on summarizing the different types of hybrid\\nmodels that can be developed and subsequently highlighting the\\nenabling qualities of such models that make them attractive for\\ndifferent process applications, following which a detailed step-by-\\nstep guideline of conceptual considerations to be made while\\ndeveloping these are provided.\\n2 Types of hybrid models\\nThough not so widely emphasized then, the hybrid modeling\\nconcept was already introduced in 1992 in some seminal works\\nsuch as (Psichogios and Ungar, 1992 ; Schubert et al., 1994a ;\\nThompson and Kramer, 1994 ). Traditionally, hybrid modeling\\nhas been categorized to have two architectures: serial and parallel\\narchitectures. As summarized inFigure 2A, the serial architecture\\nessentially involves modeling fragments of the knowledge-based\\nmodels using data-based models. In other words, the knowledge-\\nbased models rely on inputs from data-based modeling. On the\\nother hand, in a parallel architecture ( Figure 2B ), both the\\nknowledge-based and data-driven models are set up\\nsimultaneously and aggregation of the prediction from both is\\nconsidered (Thompson and Kramer, 1994).\\nThe knowledge-based models are mathematical representations\\nof the engineering know-how and process knowledge typically in the\\nform of system differential-algebraic equations. The data-based\\nmodels, on the contrary, are statistical or machine learning\\nmodels capable of learning from the patterns in the data instead\\nof relying on prior knowledge.Figures 2C, Dfurther illustrate this\\nFIGURE 2\\nSchematic representation of different architectures of hybrid models,(A) serial and(B) parallel architecture, illustrated with an example(C)- Serial\\narchitecture, (D)- Parallel architecture.\\nFrontiers in Chemical Engineering frontiersin.org03\\nNarayanan et al. 10.3389/fceng.2023.1157889\\n\\x0cwith a simple example of the case of a bioreactor both of which are\\nextremely relevant processes in the biopharma industry.\\nSince its inception, several works have demonstrated the\\nsuccessful implementation of hybrid models for different types of\\nbioprocesses with a large fraction of it based on the serial\\narchitecture (von Stosch et al., 2016 ; Narayanan et al., 2019 ;\\nBayer et al., 2021; Kotidis et al., 2021; Narayanan et al., 2021c;\\nNarayanan et al., 2021b; Cruz-Bournazou et al., 2022; Narayanan\\net al., 2022b; Narayanan et al., 2022a; Nold et al., 2023). The serial\\narchitecture is in particular advantageous owing to the fact that it\\nconstrains and segregates the information learned by the data-based\\nmodel. Subsequently, the models learned are more robust even with\\nfewer data. The parallel architecture on the other hand trains the\\ndata-based model independently of the available knowledge, thus\\nretaining all the downsides of a pure data-based model. It is here\\nworth noting that, the current article will focus only on serial\\narchitecture.\\nFurthermore, the plethora of work on such serial\\narchitecture-based hybrid modeling can be further categorized\\nmainly along two axes, as schematically illustrated in Figure 3.\\nThe ﬁrst axis, more commonly exploited in the literature, is the\\ntype of machine learning/statistical algorithm used in data-based\\nmodeling. Several options presented in the literature include\\nArtiﬁcial Neural networks or multi-layer perceptron (ANNs or\\nMLPs) ( Psichogios and Ungar, 1992 ; Schubert et al., 1994b ;\\nSchubert et al., 1994b ; Feyo de Azevedo et al., 1997 ; Chen\\net al., 2000 ; Teixeira et al., 2006 ; Von Stosch et al., 2012a ;\\nNarayanan et al., 2019 ; Bayer et al., 2021 ; Narayanan et al.,\\n2021b; Narayanan et al., 2021c ; Narayanan et al., 2022b ),\\nPrincipal Component Regression (PCR) ( Okamura et al.,\\n2022), Partial Least Square regression (PLSR) ( Von Stosch\\net al., 2011 ; Von Stosch et al., 2012b ; Carvalho et al., 2022 ),\\nTree-based models ( Hutter et al., 2017 ), Gaussian processes\\n(GPs) ( Hutter et al., 2021 ; Vega-Ramon et al., 2021 ; Cruz-\\nBournazou et al., 2022 ), and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)\\n(Pinto et al., 2022). Subsequently, efforts have also been devoted\\nto using techniques such as symbolic regression and customized\\nneural networks as data-based modeling approaches to have\\nenhanced interpretability compared to the traditional ML\\napproaches ( Narayanan et al., 2022a ; Doyle et al., 2023). The\\nsecond axis is the extent to which prior knowledge is available\\nand incorporated into the hybrid model. Conventionally, this was\\nﬁxed prior to the development of the hybrid modeling to a pre-\\ndetermined extent of knowledge support. In our recent works, we\\nhighlighted this and introduced the concept of the “degree-of-\\nhybridization ”(Narayanan et al., 2021b; Narayanan et al., 2022b)\\nwhereby the determinantal effects of introducing too little or too\\nmuch knowledge were emphasized. Subsequently, we illustrated\\nits implications for two systems of relevance for\\nbiomanufacturing, namely, the cell culture ( Narayanan et al.,\\n2022b) and the chromatographic process ( Narayanan et al.,\\n2021b). To summarize, for a given modeling task at hand, a\\nfamily of hybrid models can be developed across these two\\ndimensions: 1) type of data-bas ed algorithm and 2) extent of\\nknowledge incorporation.\\nHybrid models are at the intersection of purely knowledge-\\nbased models and purely data-based models. As a result, it\\nalleviates many of the shortco mings faced by these modeling\\nparadigms individually. The next section describes the qualities\\nof the hybrid models that make it attractive for different process\\napplications and summarizes t he literature evidences for\\nthe same.\\nFIGURE 3\\nSchematic representation of the selection along two key axes to develop hybrid models: (i) type of data-based algorithm and (ii) amount of\\nknowledge incorporation.\\nFrontiers in Chemical Engineering frontiersin.org04\\nNarayanan et al. 10.3389/fceng.2023.1157889\\n\\x0c3 Enabling qualities of hybrid models\\nHybrid modeling ﬁnds a trade-off between constraining the\\nrelationships between the governing variables while allowing for the\\nﬂexibility to learn potentially unknown interactions between them\\n(Narayanan et al., 2021b; Narayanan et al., 2022b). This is especially\\nuseful when applied to a real system with many inﬂuencing factors\\nthat present complex interactions which are only partially\\nunderstood. Some of the key qualities of hybrid models that have\\nbeen rationalized and also demonstrated quantitatively are\\nsummarized below.\\n3.1 Better accuracy\\nA purely knowledge-based model suffers the risk of constraining\\ntoo much based on biased assumptions while a purely data-driven\\nmodel suffers from the excessive ﬂexibility to learn any (even\\narbitrary) relationships based on data. The latter results in the\\nrequirement of a large amount of data to learn a generalized and\\nrepresentative model of the considered system. Given the ability of\\nhybrid models to draw a trade-off between constraining and\\nﬂexibility, in a limited data set-up such as biopharma, hybrid\\nmodels in general shows better accuracy compared to either\\nknowledge-based or data-based models.\\nSeveral hybrid modeling literature in the area of biotechnology\\n(fermentation and cell culture) have compared their performance to\\nANN (Schubert et al., 1994b; Feyo de Azevedo et al., 1997)o r\\nrecurrent neural networks (Feyo de Azevedo et al., 1997;Ferid et al.,\\n2020) with the hybrid models consistently outperforming the other\\ntwo. Subsequently, in many of the recent works including ours, the\\naccuracy of hybrid models has been quantitatively shown to\\noutperform the current industrial benchmark, PLSR1 ( Von\\nStosch et al., 2012b; Narayanan et al., 2019; Narayanan et al.,\\n2021d; Narayanan et al., 2022b). Furthermore, in our hybrid\\nmodeling work for bio chromatographic application, the accuracy\\nof hybrid models was around 40% better than the typically used\\nmechanistic model (Lumped kinetic model) for the protein-A\\ncapture step (Narayanan et al., 2021b; Narayanan et al., 2021c;\\nNarayanan et al., 2021d). Such better prediction accuracy by the\\nhybrid models correspondingly results in superior performance in\\nrelevant process applications. This has been quantitatively\\ndemonstrated, for instance, for process monitoring and control\\nby Narayanan et al. (2020a) , and von Stosch et al. (2012a)\\ncomparing against PLSR1 and ANN, respectively.\\n3.2 Lower data requirement\\nAn additional advantage of the hybrid model is its ability to\\nefﬁciently model systems where data generation capacity is limited.\\nIn theory, from a parameter estimation standpoint, knowledge-\\nbased models are probably the ones that require the least amount\\nof data if speciﬁc and independent analytics exist for the evaluation\\nof the different physically relevant parameters. In contrast, to\\nestimate parameters using macroscopic data, a signiﬁcantly large\\nnumber of experiments might still be required to decorrelate the\\ndifferent parameters and estimate their value with reasonable\\ncertainty. In addition, a lot of experiments (and maybe more\\nspecialized experiments and analytics) must be performed a\\npriori to generate and gather the required, detailed, and ideally\\nunbiased knowledge to develop such a model in theﬁrst place. For\\nmost biopharmaceutical systems such unbiased generalized\\nknowledge for different hosts and therapeutic modalities has not\\nyet been deciphered. On the other hand, theﬂexibility offered by\\ndata-driven models requires a lot of data to establish a reliable\\nmodel. Subsequently, hybrid models have shown superior predictive\\nand extrapolation (c.f.Section 4.3) capabilities with much fewer data\\ncompared to their data-driven counterparts ( Narayanan et al.,\\n2022b). In our recent work, data requirements for hybrid models\\nare compared against the PLSR models as well as the ANN with the\\nformer requiring much fewer data compared to either of the data-\\nbased alternatives (Narayanan et al., 2022b). This is rationalized by\\nthe fact that the knowledge-based part of the hybrid model\\nconstrains or segregates the problem to be learned by the ML (or\\ndata-based) model thus compensating for the reduced data.\\nIn addition, it is worth noting here that the requirement of data\\nto train a reliable model can be further minimized by using an\\nappropriate design of experiments. In the industrial setting, it is\\nstandard practice to either perform experiments in a very narrow\\nsub-region or use a classical design of experiments strategy (most\\noften factorial designs or response surface models) (Narayanan and\\nLove, 2022). However, such designs are extremely inefﬁcient in\\ncapturing the non-linear interrelationships between variables (since\\nthey are based on perturbing corners and centers of the design space)\\nthus resulting in poor representations for the model to learn\\n(Narayanan and Love, 2022 ). In this direction, in our recent\\nwork, we have quantitatively demonstrated the reduction in the\\namount of data required and the difference in model performance\\nbetween using a fractional factorial design as opposed to a uniform\\nspace-ﬁlling design such as Latin hypercube sampling [c.f. SI of\\n(Narayanan et al., 2022b)].\\n3.3 Extrapolation and process optimization\\nIn addition to improved predictive accuracy and reduced data\\nburden, hybrid models also outperform their alternatives in\\nextrapolation. Extrapolation capability is key for process\\noptimization and the ability of the models necessitated to\\nrobustly predict beyond their training regimes. It is here noted\\nthat extrapolation is implied in terms of “operation” such as a\\nchange of feeding strategies, change of mode of operation, or\\nexpanding the boundaries of process parameters. The strong\\nknowledge support in such models prevents the models from\\nlearning and subsequently predicting unrealistic behaviors when\\nused for prediction outside their training region which has been a\\nclassical skepticism around the purely data-driven model. In theory,\\nthe knowledge-based models should be the most ef ﬁcient in\\nextrapolation as they are based on physical principles. However,\\nthis is true only if the knowledge-based models are unbiased and do\\nnot rely on empirical assumptions based on a case-speciﬁc basis\\n(which unfortunately is often the case inﬁelds such as bioprocesses).\\nThe superior performance of hybrid models for extrapolation\\nhas been quantitatively demonstrated in the literature (Van Can\\net al., 1998; Narayanan et al., 2019; Narayanan et al., 2021b;\\nFrontiers in Chemical Engineering frontiersin.org05\\nNarayanan et al. 10.3389/fceng.2023.1157889\\nSince the ML model isn’t solving the entire problem, it doesn't need as much data,\\nit only needs to learn what the physics model can't explain well.\\n\\x0cNarayanan et al., 2021c; Narayanan et al., 2021d; Narayanan et al.,\\n2022a; Narayanan et al., 2022b). Subsequently, these capabilities\\nhave resulted in the successful application of hybrid models for\\nprocess applications as highlighted, for instance, by Bayer et al.\\n(2021) for scale transferability and Teixeira et al., for process\\noptimization (Schubert et al., 1994a; Galvanauskas et al., 2004;\\nTeixeira et al., 2006; Ferreira et al., 2014).\\n3.4 Physically relevant behavior and\\ninterpretability\\nFinally, hybrid models channel the information learned by the\\ndata-driven models to lumped physical parameters, resulting in\\nphysically relevant behaviors being learned and predicted by the\\nmodel. Subsequently, the qualitative trends can be interpreted from\\nthese models. For instance, it has been previously shown how the\\nimposition of mass balance in a bioreactor model results in the\\nhybrid model learning biologically consistent glucose consumption\\npatterns, as opposed to a purely statistical model which fails to learn\\nsuch behavior [we refer the readers to (Narayanan et al., 2019) and\\n(Narayanan et al., 2021d) for ﬁgures and in-depth discussions]. In\\naddition, (Narayanan et al., 2022b), have also demonstrated the\\nability to extract other types of lumped kinetic information such as\\nthe glucose consumption rates, maintenance rates, etc., as well from\\nsuch hybrid modeling approaches. Similarly, hybrid models for bio-\\nchromatographic columns have been shown to learn relevant\\nadsorption equilibrium representations (i.e., isotherms) when\\ntrained only on the breakthrough data (Narayanan et al., 2021b;\\nNarayanan et al., 2021c). The ability to extract such information\\nfrom a hybrid model makes it extremely attractive for process\\nunderstanding applications and subsequently to attain the goals\\nof QbD initiatives.\\n4 Steps to set up hybrid models\\nSubsequently, the following section will lay out the key step-by-\\nstep considerations for the development of hybrid models.\\n4.1 Deﬁne the modeling task\\nPrior to model development, the deﬁnition of the modeling task\\nis key, irrespective of the type of model that is, being developed\\n(mechanistic, data-driven, or hybrid models) (Bonvin et al., 2016).\\nThis is, in turn, determined by the associated application and\\nprocess goals. Once the process goal and the corresponding\\nmodeling task are identiﬁed, the next step is to determine the\\ninputs and outputs of the model.\\nThis is typically determined by the ability to quantify different\\nrelevant variables. For instance, in most biopharmaceuticalﬁrms, in\\nthe cell culture (or bioreactor), macroscopic variables such as the\\nconcentration of extracellular metabolites, products, and cells are\\nquantiﬁed in contrast to intracellular quantities such as the ones\\nobtained through omics techniques. This constrains the inputs and\\noutputs that can be used for the modeling tasks. In addition, if\\nhistorical data is being used, the nature of the available dataset\\n(missing information, frequency, etc.) determines the capacity of\\nmodeling and also if a reasonably reliable model can be set up, to\\nbegin with (Narayanan and Love, 2022).\\nFurthermore, which variables can be included as input in a\\nmodel and how they are to be introduced may be for different\\napplications. For instance, process optimization requires a modeling\\nsetup where the entire evolution of a process variable can be\\npredicted based on just the initial condition. On the other hand,\\nfor process monitoring online or real-time information and\\nvariables can be used in the models.\\nOnce the modeling task is deﬁned and suitable inputs and\\noutputs are decided, the model development process can\\ncommence. It is here noted that after the input and outputs have\\nbeen identiﬁed there might be a requirement for certain data pre-\\nprocessing such as missing data considerations, and frequency\\nalignment of data points collected. Typically, for purely data-\\ndriven modeling certain data transformations are also performed\\nto attain certain distribution or to achieve a certain type of non-\\nlinearity (typically in the linear model). In the case of hybrid\\nmodeling, the existing knowledge fragments often dictate or\\ncompartmentalize the functional form of the primary input,\\nwhich might undergo transformations as required within the\\nknowledge-based/mechanistic framework ( Tsopanoglou and\\nJiménez del Val, 2021).\\n4.2 Identifying knowledge fragments and\\ntheir mathematical representation\\nThe ﬁrst step in the development of a hybrid model involves\\nthe identiﬁcation of the engineering know-how and the process\\nknowledge available for the system under study. Subsequently,\\nthese knowledge fragments m ust be organized based on\\nincreasing levels of certainty. For instance, knowledge based\\non physical laws (e.g., mass balance, energy balance,\\nthermodynamics) holds higher validity as compared to\\nempirical assumptions (e.g., Monod kinetics for cell\\nmetabolism representation, Langmuir isotherm to represent\\nadsorption) which may be valid for ideal, simple systems but\\nmay not hold try for complex systems.\\nOnce the knowledge fragments are identiﬁed and sorted based\\non their certainty, their respective mathematical representations/\\nformulation must be determined. The top level of such framework\\ntypically can be represented through a system of ordinary\\ndifferential equations (e.g., to represent homogeneous macro-\\nkinetic representation of cell cultures), partial differential\\nequations (e.g., to represent chromatographic process), algebraic\\nequations (e.g., to represent a system in steady state) or a mixture of\\nthese forms summarized as differential-algebraic equations. Within\\nthese overarching frameworks, other knowledge fragments assume\\nvarious functional forms. For instance, linear representation to\\naccount for the proportional dependence of cell growth rate\\n(nutrient consumption rate, and product production rate) on the\\nviable cell density. Other manifestations of the knowledge could be\\nin form of constraints, lower and upper bounds of different input or\\ntarget variables, or even channeling the inputs received by data-\\nbased algorithm learning the missing information (discussed below\\nin Section 3.2).\\nFrontiers in Chemical Engineering frontiersin.org06\\nNarayanan et al. 10.3389/fceng.2023.1157889\\n\\x0cIt is here noted that the extent of knowledge to be incorporated,\\ncan be pre-determined (as popularly done in literature) or a family\\nof hybrid models with different fractions of knowledge can be\\ndeveloped. In the later stage, once the models are trained, a\\nchoice can be made based on the performance of the different\\nmodels on a validation set. An alternative option is to ensemble the\\nprediction from all viable models (ignoring biased models that\\nwould result in poor performance already during the training\\nphase) via stacking (Bishop, 2006; Hastie et al., 2017).\\nIn the case that a pre-determined extent of knowledge is\\nincorporated it must be ensured to avoid over-emphasizing the\\nempirical assumptions-based knowledge fragments since they risk\\nproducing an extremely biased model. Though theﬂexibility of the\\ndata-based ML model might compensate for the biased or wrong\\nknowledge enforced, it could lead to wrong interpretations, wrong\\nextrapolations, and possibly require more data to correct for the\\nmisleading knowledge backbone imposed in the hybrid model.\\nThus, it is advised to introduce knowledge, that is representative\\nof the physical correctness of the model. For instance, species-\\nspeciﬁc mass balances to account for the feed inlets and outlets\\nare absolutely certain and can be incorporated into the knowledge-\\nbased model. Such similar knowledge fragments that aid in the\\nlearning of physically consistent behaviors can be incorporated into\\nthe knowledge-based layer of the hybrid model (Figure 4).\\n4.3 Identifying missing information and\\nreplacing it with data-based models\\nSubsequently, the fragments missing a mathematical\\nrepresentation based on unbiased prior knowledge or physico-\\nchemical understanding are identiﬁed. These fragments are then\\nmodeled using statistical or machine-learning algorithms which\\noffer a plethora of options from the simplest in the form of\\nmulti-linear regression to a latent space-based algorithm such as\\nPLSR to complex non-linear models ranging from tree-based\\nalgorithms (XGBoost, Random Forest, etc.) to kernel-based\\nmethods (SVMs, GPs) to neural network-based algorithms (MLP,\\nDNN) (Bishop, 2006; Hastie et al., 2017).\\nThe choice of the algorithm can be made based on a pre-\\ndetermined rationale or a family of hybrid models can be\\ndeveloped considering the different options of the machine\\nlearning algorithm. Currently, the literature is based on the\\nformer where the machine learning algorithm is ﬁxed a priori,\\nfor instance, based on its ability toﬂexibly learn the underlying\\nunknown function. The latter is still a viable option where a single\\nmodel can be selected at a later step (i.e., using a validation test to\\nevaluate the performance of hybrid models developed using\\ndifferent algorithms.) or all the models can be retained to\\nperform ensemble modeling via stacking ( Bishop, 2006; Hastie\\net al., 2017).\\n4.4 Training hybrid model(s)\\nOnce the knowledge backbone and the algorithm to replace\\nthe missing information are de termined, the hybrid modeling\\nbackbone is in place. The next is to train these models to optimize\\nthem for the considered system, from which relevant data is\\ngenerated. There can be two approaches to training such hybrid\\nmodels. The ﬁrst involves substituting the parametric form of the\\nmachine learning algorithm into the mathematical formulation\\nof the knowledge backbone and solving the system of differential-\\nalgebraic equations using appropriate numerical techniques. The\\nother approach is to reorganize the terms in the hybrid model\\nformulation such that the entities learned by a machine learning\\nmodel can be segregated or collected as a function of all the inputs\\nto a machine learning model. Subsequently, the hybrid models\\ncan be trained like any typical machine learning model (Bishop,\\n2006; Hastie et al., 2017). It is here worth noting that when the\\nchoice of the machine learning algorithm is non-parametric (e.g.,\\ntree-based algorithms or Gaussian processes), the latter approach\\nis the only possible option since such algorithms lack a\\nparametric representation.\\n4.5 Validate hybrid model(s)\\nThe choice of the ML algorithm enforces the need to select\\ncertain hyperparameters dependent on the chosen algorithm. For\\ninstance, the number of layers, the number of hidden nodes in each\\nlayer, and the transfer function are some of the hyperparameters\\nassociated with an ANN; Gaussian processes have the kernel type\\nand mean function type as the key hyperparameters, and so on and\\nso forth for other ML algorithms. This requires the use of a\\nvalidation set (or an internal test set) to select the relevant\\nhyperparameter for the given study case.\\nIn addition, the performance of the model on this validation\\nset(s) can also be used to determine the most suitable ML algorithm\\nand the key elements of knowledge fragments, in case a series of\\nchoices was retained inSections 3.2, 3.3.\\nFIGURE 4\\nFlowchart representation of the step-by-step conceptual guide\\nto developing a hybrid model.\\nFrontiers in Chemical Engineering frontiersin.org07\\nNarayanan et al. 10.3389/fceng.2023.1157889\\n\\x0cSummarizing, the ﬁnal hybrid with the optimal corresponding\\narchitecture is chosen in this step which can subsequently be used\\nfor intended applications.\\n4.6 Apply model\\nOnce theﬁnal model is calibrated or developed it is ready to be\\nused for intended applications. Though this seems straightforward\\nfrom a scientiﬁc perspective, a number of practical hurdles might\\nmake the application of hybrid models still challenging (Canzani\\nand Timmer, 2021). However, it can be expected that with the ever-\\nfaster advancement of technologies, these hurdles become\\nsigniﬁcantly smaller over time.\\n5 Conclusion\\nThe biopharmaceutical industr yi sc u r r e n t l yf a c e dw i t ht h e\\nneed to, on the one hand, accelerate process development and\\nCMC activities for the new therapeutic modalities while on the\\nother hand thriving to increase the production of an existing\\nmolecule to meet global demands. Additionally, it can bene ﬁt\\nfrom the reduction in the market price of these therapeutics\\nmaking them accessible to a larger population. This can be\\nrealized by enhancing the ef ﬁciency of process development\\nand CMC, subsequently, reducing the development costs and\\nthus the marketed price.\\nThe growing capacities of mathematical algorithms, especially\\nderived from AI and ML, have opened up many possibilities that can\\nbe utilized to achieve several of the aforementioned targets of the\\nindustry. A key bottleneck in this regard, however, is the ability of\\nthe biopharma industry to generate a large amount of data to\\ndevelop such tools with reliability. The hybrid modeling\\nparadigm is emerging as a pragmatic solution to enable all ML\\nbeneﬁts while using limited data, especially for process development\\nand CMC activities.\\nIn this article, the key qualities of hybrid modeling that make\\nit a suitable approach have been highlighted and summarized.\\nThe major aspects include lowe r data requirements, better\\npredictive accuracy, extra polation capabilities, and\\ncomparative ease of interpretab ility and physical relevance.\\nSubsequently, a step-by-step guideline to develop a hybrid\\nmodel has been detailed to provide a series of conceptual\\nchecklists to be considered t o build a reliable and robust\\nmodel for an intended purpose.\\nDespite the advancements on the algorithmic end to take into\\naccount knowledge to reduce data requirements, the quality of data\\ncollected is still to be ensured. It is required that the paradigm of\\nexperimental design and data generation is modiﬁed to justify the\\ntransition for process modeling. The past/current experimental\\ndesign strategies rely heavily on one-factor-at-a-time approaches\\nor performing statistical DoE with a small subset of design variables\\nwhich makes it easier for human interpretation. However, in order\\nfor the process models to represent the physical system reliably, the\\neffect of multivariate interactions must be studied and data must be\\ncollected. In addition, the existing paradigm of decoupling\\nexperimental design/data collection and modeling results in\\nincreased amounts of data points (especially by probing the\\nunfavorable part of the design spaces). As a result, alternative\\napproaches such as active learning coupled with iterative\\nexperimental design would be impactful and thus could be the\\nfuture direction of research in this area. A more thorough sketch of\\nthese challenges and plausible solutions for the deployment of process\\nmodels in the biopharmaceutical industry has been highlighted in the\\nrecent commentary article (Narayanan and Love, 2022).\\nAuthor contributions\\nHN: Prepare the original draft of the manuscript; MvS, FF, and\\nMS: Review of the manuscript; AB and MM: Review of the\\nmanuscript and supervision.

Introduction\\nMathematical models serve as tools for representing physical sys-\\ntems, enabling the analysis of how these systems respond to changing\\noperating conditions and external factors. In engineering, such models\\nare indispensable for a range of applications, including large-scale\\nprocess modeling (Ali et al., 2015), process control (Kiparissides et al.,\\n1993), process monitoring (Bui et al., 2021), equation discovery from\\ndata (Raissi et al., 2019), and the critical tasks of process scale-up\\nand development (Schmidt, 2005). In chemical engineering, the use of\\naccurate mathematical models has revolutionized process development,\\nsignificantly reducing the time required for transition from laboratory\\nresearch to market implementation by effectively addressing scaling\\nchallenges (Jana, 2018; Cameron and Hangos, 2001). Models are gen-\\nerally categorized based on their underlying philosophy into three\\nprimary types. First-principles models (FPMs), also known as white-\\nbox models, are grounded in the fundamental physics of the process,\\noffering complete transparency and interpretability (Nellis and Klein,\\n2008; Chorin, 1968). On the other hand, data-driven models (DDMs)\\nrely on empirical data and statistical methods to make predictions,\\noften sacrificing interpretability for flexibility and ease of development.\\nFinally, hybrid models or gray-box models combine elements of both\\nfirst-principles and data-driven approaches, leveraging the strengths of\\neach to improve model accuracy and applicability (Zendehboudi et al.,\\n2018; Schweidtmann et al., 2023). This classification highlights the\\nspectrum of modeling approaches available, each suited to different\\ntypes of engineering problems, depending on the availability of data,\\nthe need for interpretability, and the complexity of the system being\\nmodeled.\\nFPMs are deeply rooted in the physical principles of the process,\\ntypically derived from conservation laws of energy, mass, momen-\\ntum, and transition state theory for chemical reactions (Grabow et al.,\\n2008; Taylor, 2016). Due to their basis in process physics, FPMs of-\\nfer high flexibility, extrapolation capability, and interpretability. They\\nrequire no process data, making them ideal for building models for\\nprocess monitoring, process control, model discovery, and plant scale-\\nup. FPMs might be based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs),\\npartial differential equations (PDEs) (Aziz and Khan, 2018), algebraic\\nequations (Iglesias-Silva et al., 2003), and event-based modeling frame-\\nworks (Battaile and Srolovitz, 2002). These models are complex to\\ndevelop, and capturing latent mechanisms through FPMs is challenging.\\nConversely, black-box or DDMs are based entirely on process-scale\\ndata with minimal interpretability (Alauddin et al., 2023; Ghosh et al.,\\n2022). These models are easier and cheaper to develop than FPMs\\nbut suffer from poor extrapolation capabilities and lack flexibility, as\\ntheir application domain is confined to the range of collected process\\ndata (Bangi and Kwon, 2023). The recent paradigm shift in the more\\nextensive application of DDMs over FPMs in the process industry is a re-\\nsult of the growing capability of computing architecture, which allows\\nDDMs to capture long-term spatiotemporal dependencies in the process\\ndata (Lin et al., 1996). It is important to note that DDMs are only\\ndeveloped after the actual process is set up, as the accuracy of these\\nmodels is highly dependent on high-quality process data. These models\\nexcel in managing unknown model complexities and learning from\\nhistorical process-scale data (Alhajeri et al., 2022b). Thus, the DDMs\\nare extensively used in process operation activities such as predictive\\nmaintenance, fault detection and diagnosis, process monitoring, and\\nprocess-scale decision-making (Wu et al., 2020; Kumari et al., 2022).\\nWhile these models continuously improve, data-driven approaches de-\\npend entirely on high-quality, low-noise, and low-disturbance data,\\nwhich is still challenging to obtain.\\nThe limitations of FPMs and DDMs have led to the development\\nof gray-box models, which combine the strengths of both approaches\\n(Oussar and Dreyfus, 2001; Asgari et al., 2021). These models in-\\nclude first-principles and data-driven components, aiming to maintain\\ninterpretability while reducing reliance on process data (Bohlin and\\nGraebe, 1995; Bohlin, 2013). They effectively use the DDMs’ ability to\\ncapture unknown process complexities within the framework of first-\\nprinciples equations. The term ‘‘gray-box modeling’’ emerged in the\\n90s within the systems theory literature (Psichogios and Ungar, 1992;\\nJørgensen and Hangos, 1995). Since then, various gray-box models\\nhave been applied in chemical engineering, like polymerization pro-\\ncesses (Fiedler and Schuppert, 2008), flowsheet simulators for chemical\\nprocesses (Asprion et al., 2019), distillation columns (Mahalec and\\nSanchez, 2012; Rodriguez et al., 2023), bacterial cultivations (Hong\\nand Qiu, 2008), chemical reactors (Bangi and Kwon, 2023; Azarpour\\net al., 2017; Zendehboudi et al., 2014), separation systems (Romijn\\net al., 2008), crystallization (Bogaerts et al., 2009; Sitapure and Kwon,\\n2023c; Ghosh et al., 2021), fermentations (Laursen et al., 2007; Shah\\net al., 2023b; Tornøe et al., 2004), hydraulic fracturing (Bangi and\\nKwon, 2020), and intracellular signaling pathways (Lee et al., 2020a).\\nThese models encompass semi-analytical, semi-physical, and semi-\\nparametric models (Talib et al., 2023).\\nThis tutorial review centers on hybrid models, a distinct and in-\\ncreasingly pivotal subset of gray-box models. Unlike traditional ap-\\nproaches, hybrid models uniquely integrate first-principles equations\\nwith empirically derived or data-driven methods, creating a versa-\\ntile framework capable of addressing the limitations of purely FPMs\\nor DDMs. In this work, we define hybrid models as those that use\\nfirst-principles equations as the structural backbone, while data-driven\\ncomponents capture the uncertain parameters or states that are difficult\\nto model explicitly through physics-based equations alone (Fiedler\\nand Schuppert, 2008; Kahrs and Marquardt, 2007; Kwon, 2024). The\\nnovelty of hybrid models lies in their ability to effectively capture\\nnonlinear processes and address plant-model mismatches caused by\\nuncertain parameters, which often challenge conventional modeling\\ntechniques (Thangavel et al., 2018). Furthermore, hybrid models ex-\\ncel as predictive tools in scenarios where process disturbances un-\\ndermine the reliability of FPMs (Hosen et al., 2011). Recent stud-\\nies also demonstrate that hybrid models have a broader domain of\\napplicability (Bangi and Kwon, 2023). Hybrid models incorporate a\\ndiverse array of data-driven techniques, including neural networks\\n(NNs), regression methods (linear and nonlinear), classification algo-\\nrithms (such as support vector machines (SVMs) (Adib et al., 2013)\\nand decision trees (Yarveicy et al., 2019)), subspace identification\\nmethods (Hassanpour et al., 2022; Ghosh et al., 2019) like, Approxi-\\nmate Dynamic Programming (ADP) (Singh Sidhu et al., 2018) Gaussian\\n\\x0cComputers and Chemical Engineering 194 (2025) 108926\\n3\\nP. Shah et al.\\nProcesses (GPs) (Gray and Schmidt, 2018; Jiang et al., 2019), sparse\\nregression techniques like sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical\\nSystems (SINDy) (Bhadriraju et al., 2020, 2021b), ensemble techniques\\nlike random forests (Chen et al., 2020), and Bayesian networks (Eugene\\net al., 2020; Yu et al., 2024). This combination offers exceptional flex-\\nibility and robustness in modeling complex system behaviors, enabling\\nhybrid models to capture dynamics that are difficult to describe using\\ntraditional approaches alone (Bohlin, 2006).\\nHybrid models offer significant advantages over conventional\\nDDMs, requiring less training data and providing improved inter-\\npretability and generalizability. The integration between FPMs and\\nDDMs is either done through parameters that are a part of the FP equa-\\ntions or through the estimation of discrepancy between the FP model’s\\npredictions and experimental data (Liu et al., 2021). These parameters\\nare selected through comprehensive domain knowledge or rigorous\\nstatistical sensitivity analysis, ensuring they hold physical significance\\nand highly impact the final process states. This approach captures\\nparametric and process uncertainties and reveals latent mechanisms\\nthat might be missed by traditional domain knowledge. Comprehensive\\nreviews by Von Stosch et al. (2014) and von Stosch et al. (2014)\\nhave discussed some fundamental aspects of hybrid modeling and\\nhighlighted its advantages over traditional non-hybrid models in pro-\\ncess engineering, showcasing their utility in various stages such as\\ndevelopment, validation, optimization, monitoring, control, and scal-\\ning. There have been other review articles evaluating the strengths\\nand limitations of hybrid modeling frameworks, highlighting their\\nperformance advantages, recent advances, and areas for improvement,\\nsuch as uncertainty quantification, dynamic hybrid modeling, and\\nconstraint handling (Schweidtmann et al., 2023; Sansana et al., 2021;\\nBradley et al., 2022; Sharma and Liu, 2022). There have also been some\\navailable implementations of hybrid models in the literature (Moon\\net al., 2022; Nascimento et al., 2020; Cuomo et al., 2022; Di Caprio\\net al., 2023; Merkelbach et al., 2022). While these references provide\\ncomprehensive explanations of how physics can be incorporated into\\nML models, they do not offer a detailed tutorial with step-by-step\\nimplementation using the hybrid model structure. Our focus is on\\npresenting a structured approach with complex case studies to guide\\nreaders through the implementation process, making our work distinct\\nin its practical and tutorial-oriented approach.\\nOur contribution to this tutorial review is twofold:\\n• We offer a practical guide for building hybrid models from\\nscratch, with detailed mathematical formulations, pseudo-code,\\nand real-world case studies.\\n• We provide a comprehensive overview of the foundational con-\\ncepts and recent advancements in hybrid modeling\\nThis work aims to bridge the gap between theory and application,\\nequipping researchers and practitioners with the tools to harness the\\nfull potential of hybrid models in process systems engineering. Fig. 1\\nillustrates the spectrum of different modeling techniques, emphasiz-\\ning the unique position and advantages of hybrid models within this\\nlandscape.\\nThe remainder of the manuscript is organized as follows: In Sec-\\ntion 2, preliminary terminologies are presented to understand the\\nhybrid model better. In Section 3, details about the building blocks\\nof the hybrid model are presented along with a code for the hybrid\\nmodel in TensorFlow. Section 4 highlights the application of the hy-\\nbrid models to the different segments of chemical engineering, like\\nprocess modeling, process control, process monitoring, plant scale-up,\\nand model discovery. Then, more detailed case studies highlighting\\nthe application of the hybrid models to different systems is presented.\\nSection 5 highlights an outlook on the future challenges of hybrid\\nmodeling. Finally, Section 6 offers concluding remarks.\\n2. Preliminaries\\nThis section provides an overview of the fundamental concepts in\\nhybrid modeling, encompassing both theoretical and ML components.\\nWe begin by exploring the essential modeling frameworks and asso-\\nciated terminologies, highlighting how FPMs and DDMs have been\\nutilized for various engineering applications. The discussion then high-\\nlights the limitations of FPM and DDM, and the motivation behind\\nhybrid modeling methodologies. It particularly focuses on their role\\nin identifying missing physics and latent chemical mechanisms, ex-\\npressed as time-varying and spatially-varying parameters, as well as\\nspatiotemporally-varying parameters.\\n2.1. First-principles models\\nFPMs, also called mechanistic, semi-empirical, phenomenological,\\nor white-box models, are recognized for their thoroughness, even\\nthough they are based on a simplified, idealized understanding of\\nphysical phenomena. Because they are constructed to align with the\\nlaws of physics, such as conservation, kinetics, or thermodynamics\\nlaws, through their mathematical formulations, FPMs are considered\\nboth interpretable and physically consistent. FPMs can be developed\\nby modeling the equations in programming languages like MATLAB,\\nPython, C++, and FORTRAN. FPMs can also be developed through\\nequation-oriented modeling, which involves using specialized software\\nframeworks that require the user to explicitly define all relevant vari-\\nables and equations. These frameworks typically offer user-friendly\\nprogramming environments tailored for chemical engineering appli-\\ncations. Notable examples include gPROMS, Aspen Custom Modeler,\\nDymola, ASCEND II, and JModelica.org (Elmqvist, 1978; Piela et al.,\\n1991; Åström et al., 1998; Leal et al., 2017). FPMs have been used for\\napplications like surface catalysis (Hansen and Neurock, 1999; Neurock\\nand Hansen, 1998; Lee et al., 2023), polymerization (Dotson et al.,\\n1996; Brandolin et al., 1996; Dubé et al., 1997), fermentation (Ordonez\\net al., 2016; Luedeking and Piret, 2000), reactors (Kiparissides et al.,\\n1993; Raupp et al., 2001), crystallization (Sitapure et al., 2021b;\\nNagpal et al., 2024; Hoja et al., 2017; Quintana-Hernandez et al.,\\n2004), kraft pulping (Choi and Kwon, 2019; Son et al., 2020; Fearon\\net al., 2020; Yang and Liu, 2005), lithium-ion batteries (Pannala et al.,\\n2015; Katrašnik et al., 2021; Lee et al., 2021), solar cells (Crose et al.,\\n2015; Basore, 1990; De Falco et al., 2012), distillation (Taylor and\\nKrishna, 2000; Mueller and Kenig, 2007), quantum dots (Zhu et al.,\\n2007; Sitapure et al., 2021a; Kuno et al., 2003), phase equilibria (Liu,\\n2009; Tsivintzelis et al., 2010), and material chemistry (Greeley and\\nMavrikakis, 2004; Van der Ven et al., 1998).\\nIn certain instances, these modeling techniques may be unfamiliar to\\nmodelers or inappropriate for particular research projects. For example,\\nthere are no readily available open-source packages for conducting bi-\\nfurcation analysis on thermally coupled distillation columns. Therefore,\\nto carry out a hysteresis study, a blend of different libraries (MatCont\\nand Aspen) is required (Carranza-Abaíd and González-García, 2020).\\nAnother challenge in developing FPMs is the significant need for vari-\\nous model subroutines to enhance the core FPM. For instance, modeling\\nan absorption column necessitates supplementary models for vapor–\\nliquid equilibrium, kinetics, viscosity, surface tension, diffusivity, and\\npacking correlations.\\nTo better understand FPMs, let us consider a system whose state at\\ntime 𝑡 is described by a vector 𝑥(𝑡) ∈ R𝑛, where 𝑥(𝑡) could represent\\nconcentrations of chemical species in a reactor or temperatures in a\\nthermal system. The evolution of this system is governed by an ODE of\\nthe form:\\n𝑑 𝑥\\n𝑑 𝑡 =𝑓(𝑥(𝑡), 𝑢(𝑡), 𝑝), 𝑥(0) =𝑥0 (1)\\nHere, 𝑥(𝑡) is the state vector, 𝑢(𝑡) is an input or control vector\\n(e.g., heat input, flow rates), 𝑝 represents the parameters of the sys-\\ntem (e.g., reaction rates, diffusion coefficients), and 𝑓 is a function\\n\\x0cComputers and Chemical Engineering 194 (2025) 108926\\n4\\nP.

While FPMs can take the form of ODEs,\\nPDEs, and even include algebraic equations or states, for the purposes\\nof this tutorial review and step-by-step implementation, we primarily\\nfocus on systems modeled by ODEs, as illustrated in Eq. (1). However,\\nit is important to note that the approach discussed here equally applies\\nto systems involving algebraic equations, though our specific case\\nstudies in Section 4.2 focus on differential equations. This broader\\napplicability allows for flexibility in extending the hybrid modeling\\nframework to a variety of system types. In subsequent sections, we will\\ndemonstrate how hybrid models can integrate these FPMs with data-\\ndriven components to address uncertainties and complex mechanisms\\nin system dynamics that are not captured by first-principles alone.\\n2.2. Data-driven Models (DDMs)\\nDDMs, based on data rather than explicit causal relationships be-\\ntween variables, utilize a set of equations that depend heavily on the\\ndata’s quality rather than their mathematical form. This lack of clarity\\nin how they process information earns them the nickname ‘‘black\\nboxes’’. In chemical engineering, key data-driven modeling approaches\\ncan be categorized into several broad areas. Regression techniques,\\nincluding both linear and nonlinear regression models, are often used to\\ncapture the relationship between input and output variables (Khataee\\net al., 2014; Özdemir et al., 2011). Classification methods, such as\\nSVMs (Bansal et al., 2012) and decision trees (Yarveicy et al., 2019;\\nGhiasi and Mohammadi, 2017), are widely employed for tasks that re-\\nquire sorting data into predefined categories. Probabilistic models, like\\nBayesian networks, are used to handle uncertainties and probabilistic\\nrelationships between variables (Kumari et al., 2022; Galagali and Mar-\\nzouk, 2015; Pahari et al., 2021b). Ensemble methods, including random\\nforests, combine multiple models to improve prediction accuracy and\\nhandle complex, nonlinear interactions (Ren et al., 2017; Chen et al.,\\n2020). Nonlinear systems modeling techniques, such as deep neural\\nnetworks (DNNs) (Shah et al., 2023a; Choi et al., 2023) and multi-\\nvariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) (Yang et al., 2003; Alotaibi\\net al., 2020), are particularly useful for modeling complex, nonlinear\\nsystems. Additionally, dimensionality reduction methods, like principal\\ncomponent analysis (PCA) and other latent variable techniques, help\\nin reducing the dimensionality of data while retaining its key features\\nand are often used for noise reduction or feature extraction (Zhou\\net al., 2016; Garg and Mhaskar, 2017; Bao et al., 2019; Narasingam\\nand Kwon, 2018). Koopman operator theory helps in representing\\nnonlinear dynamical systems in a linear framework, which can fa-\\ncilitate the analysis and control of such systems in high-dimensional\\nspaces (Narasingam and Kwon, 2019; Wang and Wu, 2024; Zhang\\net al., 2023). Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) has also been\\nwidely used to decompose complex systems into dynamically relevant\\nmodes, providing insights into the temporal evolution of these systems\\nby extracting coherent structures from time-series data (Narasingam\\nand Kwon, 2017; Son et al., 2022a; Williams et al., 2015). SINDy is\\na data-driven method that uses sparse regression to discover the un-\\nderlying governing equations of nonlinear dynamical systems directly\\nfrom observational data (Brunton et al., 2016; Bhadriraju et al., 2019,\\n2021a).\\nANNs stand out for their capability to handle complex, nonlinear\\nsystems (Bishop and Nasrabadi, 2006). They were initially inspired by\\nthe structure of biological brains, aiming to mimic how humans process\\ninformation. Despite their neuroscientific origins, ANNs have found\\nbroader applications in fields like data science and computer science\\ndue to their ability to approximate any function, a property proven\\nin the late 1980s. In the past 15–20 years, ANNs have been used for\\nvarious engineering applications (Himmelblau, 2008; Pirdashti et al.,\\n2013; Kirilova, 2022). Structurally, ANNs consist of input, hidden, and\\noutput layers. The input layer receives data, the output layer presents\\n\\x0cComputers and Chemical Engineering 194 (2025) 108926\\n5\\nP. Shah et al.\\nthe results, and the hidden layers, made up of neurons, process the\\ninput data to predict outputs. These neurons transform input data\\nby combining input vectors, typically through linear combinations or\\nelement-by-element multiplication, primarily used in image processing\\nand classification. The transformation process often involves applying\\na nonlinear or logical transfer function, such as the hyperbolic tangent,\\nlog-sigmoid function, or rectified linear unit (ReLU). However, linear\\nfunctions can also be used in some cases. In traditional ANNs, there\\nare typically only one or a few hidden layers, and these networks are\\ndesigned to handle relatively simpler, nonlinear relationships between\\ninputs and outputs. DNNs, on the other hand, are a specific type of ANN\\ncharacterized by having multiple hidden layers—often several or more.\\nThis depth allows DNNs to learn hierarchical representations of data,\\ncapturing more complex patterns and features than a standard ANN\\ncan. In essence, while all DNNs are ANNs, not all ANNs are DNNs. The\\nkey distinction is the number of hidden layers, with DNNs being used\\nfor more complex tasks that require capturing intricate relationships in\\nlarge datasets. In this review paper, we will use DNN as the standard in\\nour hybrid model. While DNNs are a popular tool for hybrid modeling\\ndue to their flexibility and ability to approximate nonlinear functions,\\nother machine learning techniques, such as SVMs, GPs, decision trees,\\nsubspace identification models, and multivariate regression models,\\nhave also proven effective in handling process uncertainties and provid-\\ning predictive insights. The choice of method depends on the specific\\nsystem dynamics, available data, and desired interpretability of the\\nmodel. For the purpose of this review article, we use DNNs to illustrate\\nthe steps involved in integrating DDMs with FPMs.\\nDNNs consist of NNs incorporating multiple hidden layers, each\\ncomprising several neurons, as shown in Fig. 2 (Szegedy et al., 2013;\\nGawehn et al., 2016). Within each layer, every neuron connects to\\nevery neuron in the subsequent and preceding layers. Let 𝑛𝑘+1(𝑖)be the\\ncumulative input received by unit 𝑖 in layer 𝑘+ 1which is given as\\n𝑛𝑘+1(𝑖) =\\n𝑆𝑘∑\\n𝑗=1\\n𝑤𝑘+1(𝑗 , 𝑖)𝑎𝑘(𝑗) +𝑏𝑘+1(𝑖) (2)\\nwhere 𝑆𝑘 is the number of neurons in layer 𝑘. These interconnections\\nare characterized by a parameter known as the weight, denoted by\\n𝑤. Furthermore, the neurons in each layer are assigned a bias term,\\nrepresented by 𝑏, and are associated with a specific activation function,\\ndenoted by 𝑓. 𝑎𝑘(𝑗)is the output of unit 𝑗 in layer 𝑘 which is given as\\n𝑎𝑘(𝑗) =𝑓𝑘(𝑛𝑘(𝑗)), 𝑗 = 1,…, 𝑆𝑘 (3)\\nAssuming there are 𝑀 layers in the network, the equations in matrix\\nform can be represented as\\n𝐴𝑘 =𝐹𝑘(𝑊𝑘𝐴𝑘−1 +𝐵𝑘), 𝑘= 0,1,…, 𝑀− 1\\n𝐴0 =𝑢𝑞, 𝑞= 1,2,…, 𝑄\\n(4)\\nwhere 𝑢𝑞 is the input vector given to the NN whose corresponding\\noutput is 𝐴𝑀\\n𝑞 obtained at the final layer 𝑀. The column vectors 𝐴𝑘, 𝐹𝑘,\\nand 𝐵𝑘 contain the outputs, the activation functions, and biases of all\\nthe neurons in layer 𝑘, respectively. The matrix 𝑊𝑘 contains weights\\nassociated with the neurons in layers 𝑘 and 𝑘− 1; in particular, each\\nrow contains all the weights associated with a specific neuron of layer\\n𝑘, and the number of columns is equal to the number of neurons in layer\\n𝑘− 1. The aim of the DNN is to learn the functional relationship between\\ninput and output pairs {(𝑢1, 𝑦1\\n),(𝑢2, 𝑦2\\n),…(𝑢𝑄, 𝑦𝑄\\n)}. The accuracy of\\nthe DNN is measured as follows:\\n𝑉 = 1\\n2\\n𝑄∑\\n𝑞=1\\n𝑒𝑇\\n𝑞 𝑒𝑞\\n𝑒𝑞 =𝑦𝑞 −𝐴𝑀\\n𝑞\\n(5)\\nwhere 𝑉 is the summation of error over the entire duration, and 𝑒𝑞 is\\nthe error between the predicted output 𝐴𝑀\\n𝑞 , and the actual output 𝑦𝑞\\nwhen the 𝑞th input (i.e., 𝑢𝑞) is fed to the DNN. The error matrix 𝐸 can\\nbe defined as follows:\\n𝐸 =[𝑒1 𝑒2…𝑒𝑄\\n]𝑇 (6)\\n2.3. Hybrid models\\nFPMs often face limitations due to gaps in system knowledge.\\nThese gaps pose significant challenges in accurately identifying and\\nincorporating physics components necessary for modeling latent chem-\\nical reactions and dependencies on unobservable state variables. The\\ndifficulty in determining which elements to integrate increases without\\na comprehensive system understanding, hindering the ability to capture\\nthe full spectrum of system dynamics. On the other hand, ML models\\ndepend heavily on the quality of the data on which they are trained.\\nDespite their flexibility, the effectiveness of ML models is closely tied\\nto acquiring high-quality data, a task complicated by noise and dis-\\nturbances in real-world processes. This dependency on data quality\\nchallenges the creation of robust models that can reliably interpret and\\npredict based on underlying process data. Hybrid modeling addresses\\nthese challenges by combining the strengths of both approaches. It\\nintegrates the broad applicability and interpretability of FPMs, which\\nare based on system-independent physics laws, with the adaptability\\nof ML models to leverage system-specific process data. Compared to\\nFPMs, hybrid models offer superior extrapolation capabilities beyond\\nthe data range, although the conditions required to guarantee their\\nextrapolation accuracy require further research.\\nHybrid models can be constructed using serial or parallel hybrid\\nframeworks (Sansana et al., 2021) as shown in Fig. 3. The core concept\\nremains consistent, but the interaction between FPMs and DDMs varies.\\nIn serial hybrid modeling, DDMs and FPMs are aligned sequentially.\\nInput variables are introduced into the DDM, which then passes its\\noutput to the FPM, or vice versa (Tsen et al., 1996). Psichogios and\\nUngar (Psichogios and Ungar, 1992) first utilized this method in fed-\\nbatch bioreactors, replacing empirical elements of a kinetic model\\nwith an ANN. Applications include predicting pulp quality (Aguiar\\nand Maciel Filho, 2001), polymerization kinetics (Tian et al., 2001),\\nfermentation processes (Bazaei and Majd, 2003; Bangi et al., 2022),\\nand ethylene glycol production (Kahrs et al., 2009). In contrast, the\\nparallel hybrid modeling framework develops the FPM separately from\\nthe DDM. The DDM predicts the discrepancy between the FPM’s outputs\\nand experimental results. This approach was pioneered by Su et al.\\n(1993) for reactor system models, where outputs from both models\\nwere combined. Thompson and Kramer (1994) later applied a simi-\\nlar methodology to predict fermentation kinetics. Recently, advanced\\nalgorithms have improved the accuracy of parallel hybrid models in\\napplications such as flowmeters (Bikmukhametov and Jäschke, 2020).\\n2.3.1. Training algorithms for DNN\\nThe error backpropagation (EBP) algorithm (Rumelhart et al., 1986;\\nWerbos, 1988) represents a pivotal advancement in the training of\\nthe DNN. However, it is often criticized for its slow convergence,\\nwhich can be attributed to two primary factors. First, the step size\\nmust be kept small to avoid oscillations around the desired minima,\\ninevitably resulting in a slower training process. Second, the curvature\\nof the error surface can vary across different directions, introducing the\\nclassic ‘‘error valley’’ problem (Osborne, 1992), which further hinders\\nthe convergence rate. Despite these drawbacks, the steepest descent\\nalgorithm remains a prevalent method for training NNs. Its update rule\\nleverages the gradient 𝑔, the first-order derivative of the total error\\nfunction, defined as follows:\\n𝑔= 𝜕 𝑉(𝑢, 𝑤)\\n𝜕 𝑤 =\\n[ 𝜕 𝑉\\n𝜕 𝑤1\\n𝜕 𝑉\\n𝜕 𝑤2\\n… 𝜕 𝑉\\n𝜕 𝑤𝑁\\n]𝑇\\n(7)\\nThe update rule of the steepest descent algorithm is written as:\\n𝑤𝑘+1 =𝑤𝑘 −𝛼 𝑔𝑘 (8)\\nwhere 𝛼 is the learning constant. The issue of slow convergence in\\nthe steepest descent algorithm can be mitigated by employing the\\nGauss–Newton algorithm (Osborne, 1992). This algorithm leverages\\nthe second-order derivatives of the error function to accurately assess\\n\\x0cComputers and Chemical Engineering 194 (2025) 108926\\n6\\nP. Shah et al.\\nFig. 2.

This algorithm operates as the steepest descent\\nmethod when the curvature of the error surface is complex. Once the\\nlocal curvature approximates a quadratic surface, it functions as the\\nGauss–Newton algorithm. Essentially, the Levenberg–Marquardt algo-\\nrithm alternates between utilizing the advantageous features of both\\nthe steepest descent and Gauss–Newton algorithms, depending on the\\nsituational requirements. The update rule of the Levenberg–Marquardt\\nalgorithm is defined as follows:\\n𝑤𝑘+1 =𝑤𝑘 − (𝐽𝑇\\n𝑘 𝐽𝑘 +𝜇 𝐼)−1𝐽𝑘𝐸𝑘 (11)\\nwhere 𝜇 is the combination coefficient, and 𝐼 is the identity matrix.\\nWhen the 𝜇 value is large, the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm be-\\nhaves as the steepest descent method; otherwise, it behaves as the\\nGauss–Newton method (see Table 1).\\n2.3.2. Hybrid model training\\nHybrid models combine the strengths of both ODEs and DNNs.\\nOne way to achieve this is by integrating a DNN within an ODE\\nframework. Consider a scenario where the system dynamics 𝑓 are\\npartially unknown or too complex to model explicitly. A DNN can be\\nused to approximate this unknown function 𝑔:\\n𝑑 𝑥\\n𝑑 𝑡 =𝑓(𝑥(𝑡), 𝑢(𝑡), 𝑝)\\n𝑝=𝑔(𝑥, 𝑢)\\n𝐴𝑀 =𝑝\\n(12)\\nThis equation represents a hybrid model where the DNN learns the\\ncomplex dynamics directly from data, guided by the structure provided\\nby the ODE framework. The parameters 𝑝 are not unknown but are\\nunderstood to be important for accurate modeling of the process. For\\ninstance, in biological reactions, the cell growth rate and the corre-\\nsponding reaction kinetics are usually unknown and difficult to derive\\nfrom first-principles. Consequently, the FPMs of such processes will\\ncontain unknown terms. These parameters are related to the states 𝑥\\nand inputs 𝑢through the equation 𝑔. The DNN, as shown in Eq. (4), can\\ndetermine these unknown terms. The input to the NN model consists of\\nthe system’s current state, 𝑥𝑘, and the external input, 𝑢𝑘, with its output\\nbeing the current parameter value, 𝑝 (this is equal to the DNN output\\n𝐴𝑀\\n𝑞 ). This output is then integrated with the current state and input (𝑥𝑘\\nand 𝑢𝑘) as inputs to the FPM, which forecasts the system’s state at the\\nnext time step (𝑥𝑘+1), as shown in Fig. 4.\\nTo activate the NN, it must first undergo training using input and\\nstate measurements. The network is initialized with specific hyperpa-\\nrameters, which are then adjusted by backpropagating an error signal\\nthroughout the network. In the context of the hybrid model, the output\\nfrom the NN, which are physically interpretable parameters, is indi-\\nrectly assessed since it is not directly measurable. Training is deemed\\ncomplete when the discrepancy between the hybrid model’s predictions\\nand the actual observations is within an acceptable margin of error.\\nOnce adequately trained, the NN, in tandem with the FPM, operates\\nas the hybrid model. Thus, hybrid modeling offers a robust framework\\nfor tackling complex systems where traditional modeling approaches\\nfall short. By leveraging the strengths of DDMs and theoretical models\\nwhich are in the form of ODEs, researchers can gain deeper insights\\ninto the underlying mechanisms of the systems they study.\\nTo explain further, we consider an example system described by a\\nset of ODEs representing multiple interacting components or species in\\na biological system:\\n𝑑 𝑥\\n𝑑 𝑡 =𝑓1(𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑝1) =𝑝1 ⋅𝑥⋅(1 −𝑥) −𝛼⋅𝑥⋅𝑦 (13)\\n𝑑 𝑦\\n𝑑 𝑡 =𝑓2(𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑝2) =𝛽⋅𝑥⋅𝑦−𝛿⋅𝑦 (14)\\n\\x0cComputers and Chemical Engineering 194 (2025) 108926\\n7\\nP. Shah et al.\\nFig. 3. Hybrid model structures with different configurations: (A) Series (FPM followed\\nby DDM); (B) Series (DDM followed by FPM); and (C) Parallel.\\nFig. 4. NN-based hybrid model.\\nHere, 𝑥 and 𝑦 represent the populations of two species, 𝑝1 and 𝑝2\\nare parameters dictating growth rates, 𝛼, 𝛽, and 𝛿 are interaction\\ncoefficients, and 𝑓1 and 𝑓2 describe the interactions between these\\nspecies.\\nHybrid modeling involves using a DNN to either augment or replace\\ncomponents of an ODE system. For example, if the interaction term\\n𝛼⋅𝑥⋅𝑦in the ODE system is poorly understood, a DNN can be trained\\nto approximate this term using experimental data:\\n𝑑 𝑥\\n𝑑 𝑡 =𝑝1 ⋅𝑥⋅(1 −𝑥) −𝑔(𝑥, 𝑦) (15)\\n𝑑 𝑦\\n𝑑 𝑡 =𝛽⋅𝑥⋅𝑦−𝛿⋅𝑦 (16)\\nIn this case, 𝑔(𝑥, 𝑦)represents the output of a DNN designed to predict\\nthe interaction term, taking the state variables 𝑥 and 𝑦 as input. This\\napproach allows for modeling complex interactions that are difficult\\nto capture with traditional ODEs alone. This approach leverages the\\nbest of both worlds: the interpretability and theoretical underpinnings\\nof ODEs and the flexibility and learning capabilities of DNNs, which\\ninclude the different types of algorithms and activation functions that\\ncan be used for hybrid model training. If the input and output of\\nthe DNN vary over an order of magnitude, significant issues can arise\\nduring the training process. It is advisable to scale the inputs and\\noutputs or render them dimensionless to mitigate these challenges.\\nWe use an input–output training data set (𝑢1, 𝑦1), (𝑢2, 𝑦2), ....(𝑢𝑞, 𝑦𝑞),\\n….(𝑢𝑄, 𝑦𝑄) to train the hybrid model which includes a DNN to ap-\\nproximate the unknown parameters 𝑝. The inputs 𝑢 are presented to\\nthe hybrid model, including the first principles model and the DNN.\\nThe inputs to the DNN propagate through its layers, resulting in the\\nnetwork’s outputs at the final layer. Eqs.  (2)–(4) are  employed to\\ncompute the DNN outputs corresponding to the predicted parameter\\nvalues 𝑝. These predictions are subsequently used as inputs to the first\\nprinciples model to determine the outputs of the hybrid model, denoted\\nas 𝑦′. For the hybrid model, the squared prediction error of the output\\nacross all 𝑄 training patterns is minimized as follows:\\n̂𝑉 = 1\\n𝑄\\n1\\n2\\n𝑄∑\\n𝑞=1\\n(𝑒𝑞)𝑇(𝑒𝑞) (17)\\nwhere\\n𝑒𝑞 =𝑦𝑞 −𝑦′\\n𝑞 (18)\\nThe DNN’s output 𝑝𝑞 does not explicitly appear in the above error\\nequation as it is generated and utilized internally in the hybrid model.\\nIn order to update the parameters of DNN using Eqs. (13) and (14),\\nthe effect of the DNN’s output 𝑝𝑞 on the prediction error of the hybrid\\nmodel 𝑒𝑞 needs to be quantified. For this purpose, we utilize finite\\ndifference methods to calculate the gradient of the hybrid model’s\\noutput 𝑦′\\n𝑞 with respect to the DNN’s output 𝑝𝑞. Hence, we obtain the\\nfollowing equations:\\n𝜕 𝑒𝑞\\n𝜕 𝑦′\\n𝑞\\n= −1 (19)\\n𝜕 𝑦′\\n𝑞\\n𝜕 𝑝𝑞\\n=\\n𝑦′\\n𝑞+1 − 2𝑦′\\n𝑞 +𝑦′\\n𝑞−1\\n𝑝𝑞+1 −𝑝𝑞−1\\n(20)\\nand it follows that\\n𝜕 𝑒𝑞\\n𝜕 𝑝𝑞\\n=\\n𝜕 𝑒𝑞\\n𝜕 𝑦′\\n𝑞\\n𝜕 𝑦′\\n𝑞\\n𝜕 𝑝𝑞\\n= −\\n𝑦′\\n𝑞+1 − 2𝑦′\\n𝑞 +𝑦′\\n𝑞−1\\n𝑝𝑞+1 −𝑝𝑞−1\\n(21)\\nLet us define the sensitivity of the error 𝑒𝑞 to changes in the net input\\nof unit 𝑖 in layer 𝑘 as:\\n𝛿𝑘\\n𝑞(𝑖) =\\n𝜕 𝑒𝑞\\n𝜕 𝑛𝑘\\n𝑞(𝑖) (22)\\nNow, the above equation can be rewritten using Eq. (4) as:\\n𝛿𝑘\\n𝑞(𝑖) =\\n𝜕 𝑒𝑞\\n𝜕 𝑛𝑘\\n𝑞(𝑖) =\\n𝜕 𝑒𝑞\\n𝜕 𝑎𝑘\\n𝑞(𝑖)\\n𝜕 𝑎𝑘\\n𝑞(𝑖)\\n𝜕 𝑛𝑘\\n𝑞(𝑖) =\\n𝜕 𝑒𝑞\\n𝜕 𝑎𝑘\\n𝑞(𝑖)\\ṅ𝑓𝑘(𝑛𝑘(𝑖)) (23)\\nFor the last layer M, the above equation leads to:\\n𝛿𝑀\\n𝑞 =\\n𝜕 𝑒𝑞\\n𝜕 𝐴𝑀\\n𝑞\\ṅ𝐹𝑀(𝑛𝑀\\n𝑞 ) (24)\\nBut the output 𝐴𝑀\\n𝑞 from the final layer 𝑀 is the predicted parameter\\n𝑝𝑞, which results in\\n𝜕 𝑒𝑞\\n𝜕 𝑝𝑞\\n=\\n𝜕 𝑒𝑞\\n𝜕 𝐴𝑀\\n𝑞\\n(25)\\nUsing Eqs.  (21)–(25), the 𝛿𝑀\\n𝑞 value can be calculated. The Jacobian\\nmatrix encompasses the sensitivities of the error 𝑒𝑞 with respect to\\n\\x0cComputers and Chemical Engineering 194 (2025) 108926\\n8\\nP. Shah et al.\\nvariations in the hyperparameters of the DNN, specifically the weights\\n𝑊𝑘 and biases 𝐵𝑘. Mathematically, these sensitivities are expressed as\\n𝜕 𝑒𝑞\\n𝜕 𝑊𝑘 and\\n𝜕 𝑒𝑞\\n𝜕 𝐵𝑘 , and can be computed for the neurons in the final layer\\n𝑀 using 𝛿𝑀\\n𝑞 and Eq. (2), as follows:\\n𝜕 𝑒𝑞\\n𝜕 𝑊𝑀 =𝛿𝑀\\n𝑞 𝐴𝑀−1\\n𝑞 (26)\\n𝜕 𝑒𝑞\\n𝜕 𝐵𝑀 =𝛿𝑀\\n𝑞 (27)\\nFor other layers, 𝑘= 1, ..., 𝑀− 1, 𝛿𝑘\\n𝑞 value can be calculated using the\\nfollowing recurrence relation:\\n𝛿𝑘\\n𝑞 = ̇𝐹𝑘(𝑛𝑘\\n𝑞)𝑊𝑘+1𝑇\\n𝛿𝑘+1\\n𝑞 (28)\\nUsing the value of 𝛿𝑘\\n𝑞, the Jacobian matrix can be computed like that\\nused for deriving Eqs.  (26) and ( 27). Once the Jacobian matrix is\\ncalculated, the parameters of the DNN can be updated using Eq. (11).\\nThe Levenberg–Marquardt training algorithm begins with an initial\\nvalue for 𝜇, multiplied by a factor 𝛽 whenever an update increases ̂𝑉.\\nConversely, when an update reduces the ̂𝑉 value, 𝜇 is divided by 𝛽.\\nThe training algorithm continues iteratively until the ̂𝑉 value reaches\\na predefined tolerance.\\n2.3.3. Sensitivity analysis\\nOne central aspect we have not discussed yet is what exactly these\\nparameters 𝑝are and how they are selected. These unknown parameters\\n𝑝 are any physically interpretable parameters used in FPMs. There\\nmight be very complex models with hundreds of these parameters (Lee\\net al., 2019). A sensitivity analysis-based approach is paramount to\\nselecting which ones to estimate using the DNN. A sensitivity analysis\\nhelps understand which parameters significantly influence the outputs,\\nand a local or global sensitivity analysis (GSA) can be performed.\\nLocal sensitivity analysis around the nominal values of the model\\nparameters is initially carried out to understand how the model param-\\neters and initial conditions influence the different outputs. A sensitivity\\nmatrix is first derived from developing the parameter set, which affects\\nthe outputs (Chu and Hahn, 2007; Lee et al., 2018). To capture the\\neffect that these parameters have on the outputs, a criterion called the\\nFisher Information Matrix (FIM) is calculated in the form of a sensitivity\\nmatrix as follows:\\n𝐹 𝐼 𝑀 =𝑆𝑇𝛴 𝑆 (29)\\nwhere 𝛴 is an identity matrix of size 𝑛 ×𝑛 (where 𝑛 represents the\\nnumber of measurements or outputs), and 𝑆 is the sensitivity matrix\\nwith dimensions 𝑛×𝑝 (where 𝑝 represents the number of parameters\\nbeing estimated). The FIM itself is a matrix of size 𝑝×𝑝, meaning it\\nencapsulates the sensitivity of 𝑝parameters across the 𝑛outputs. If the\\ngoal is to select a single parameter that provides the most information,\\nwe can evaluate the FIM for each parameter individually. By extracting\\nthe 𝑖th column 𝑆𝑖 of the sensitivity matrix, we can compute the FIM for\\neach parameter as:\\nFIM𝑖 =𝑆𝑇\\n𝑖 𝛴 𝑆𝑖 (30)\\nwhere 𝑆𝑖 is the sensitivity of the system with respect to the 𝑖th pa-\\nrameter. Since 𝛴 is typically an identity matrix, the FIM for a single\\nparameter simplifies to:\\nFIM𝑖 =𝑆𝑇\\n𝑖 𝑆𝑖 (31)\\nThis scalar value represents the Fisher information for the 𝑖th param-\\neter. A specific criterion is required to evaluate the information in the\\nFIM, and the D-optimality criterion (𝜙𝐷) is used for this purpose. It\\nminimizes the logarithm of the determinant of the inverse of the FIM.\\nUsing the inverse determinant property:\\n𝜙∗\\n𝐷 = max 𝜙𝐷 (𝐹 𝐼 𝑀) = max log det (𝐹 𝐼 𝑀) (32)\\nThis criterion helps identify the most informative parameters by maxi-\\nmizing the determinant of the FIM, thus ensuring the sensitivity anal-\\nysis considers the full range of parameters and their impact on the\\nmodel’s output.\\nFor this sensitivity analysis, one parameter is evaluated at a time,\\nand 𝜙𝐷 is computed to show its effect on output. A higher 𝜙𝐷 value im-\\nplies that the concerned model parameter influences the output more.\\nAs the process states in the kinetic model are measurable, these states\\nare the model outputs 𝑦, i.e., 𝑦=𝑥, where 𝑥is the state. It is important\\nto note that this is one approach, and different sensitivity analysis\\napproaches can be utilized to identify the most critical parameters 𝑝.\\nGiven the significant parameter variation across different datasets,\\noperating conditions, and measurement changes, conducting a GSA\\nis crucial. This analysis assesses the output sensitivity over a wide\\nrange of parameter values. By running multiple experimental datasets\\nwith slight changes in initial parameter guesses and bounds, one can\\ndetermine the parameter range for the global sensitivity model. From\\nthese runs, the estimated parameter values establish an overall range\\nfor each parameter and initial condition, with a 20%–50% margin of\\nerror to cover the maximum possible range. A comprehensive range is\\npreferred to account for varying parameter estimates across different\\ndatasets and to evaluate how outputs respond to parameter values far\\nfrom their nominal values.\\nFor the GSA, 𝑙 ℎ𝑠𝑑 𝑒𝑠𝑖𝑔 𝑛 (Latin hypercube sampling) is one method\\nthat can be used to construct a matrix of random values between 0\\nand 1 for each parameter. One hundred or more different cases of\\nparameter sets can be considered for this analysis and are averaged at\\nthe end. All output effects are considered together in the combined GSA\\nof the developed kinetic model. The combined GSA of the model and\\nthe range of each parameter is as shown below:\\n𝜙𝐷(𝑚𝑜𝑑 𝑒𝑙) =𝜙𝐷(𝑆 𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑒 1) +𝜙𝐷(𝑆 𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑒 2) +𝜙𝐷(𝑆 𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑒 3) +⋯...

Traditional FPMs\\noften rely on assumptions and simplifications that, while necessary\\nfor tractability, can distance the model from real-world complexities.\\nDynamic process data, rich in detail and reflective of the system’s actual\\nbehavior, offers a wealth of information that can be harnessed to bridge\\nthis gap. By dynamically updating model parameters or structures\\nbased on real-time or historical data, hybrid models can adapt to\\nchanges in system states or operating conditions (Lee et al., 2020b).\\nThis adaptability ensures that the model remains closely aligned with\\nthe underlying physical processes it seeks to represent, thereby enhanc-\\ning the accuracy of its predictions. Furthermore, the iterative process\\nof integrating process data helps identify and correct discrepancies be-\\ntween model predictions and observed outcomes, leading to continuous\\nmodel improvement. As such, hybrid models hold significant promise\\nfor advancing our understanding of complex phenomena in science and\\nengineering.\\n3. Step-by-step implementation of hybrid modeling framework\\nSection 3 provides the methodology proposed by researchers to\\nbuild a NN-based hybrid model, giving a brief background about DNNs\\nand the backpropagation algorithm used to train them (Shah et al.,\\n2022). The section describes the components of hybrid models, includ-\\ning theoretical equations and ML algorithms, and further explains how\\nthese components interact within the hybrid framework. This section\\nof the review will discuss the foundational aspects of this approach.\\nInitially, the tables below will be used to describe the steps involved\\nin the different blocks of hybrid modeling, and then the detailed code\\nwill be discussed. The pseudo-code for integrating a DNN into a hybrid\\nmodel is a series of steps that take the output of a pre-trained DNN\\nand combine it with other inputs to create a model informed by ML\\nand domain-specific knowledge, such as physics laws or empirical\\nequations. We break down each step in detail.\\nThe fermentation process is taken as an example to demonstrate\\nthe steps to build a hybrid model.

These initial conditions\\nare essential for starting the simulation accurately. In Step 2, the time\\nframe for the simulation is then defined, specifying the start time\\n(𝑡𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡), end time (𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑑), and time step (𝑑 𝑡). In Step 3, the arrays are\\ninitialized to store the values of biomass, product, and substrate over\\nthe simulation period. The time array is also initialized to keep track\\nof the simulation time. In Step 4, a loop is run over the defined time\\nframe, updating the values of biomass, product, and substrate at each\\ntime step using the ODEs. In each iteration of the loop, the specific\\ngrowth rate (𝜇) is calculated using the Monod equation. The rate of\\nchange of biomass (𝑑 𝑋 𝑑 𝑡), product (𝑑 𝑃 𝑑 𝑡), and substrate (𝑑 𝑆 𝑑 𝑡) are\\nthen computed. These rates are used to update the current values of\\nbiomass, product, and substrate. The updated values are appended to\\ntheir respective arrays, and the time is incremented by the time step\\n(𝑑 𝑡). Once the loop completes, the arrays containing the time, biomass,\\nproduct, and substrate values are returned in Step 5. These results\\nprovide a detailed simulation of the fermentation process, capturing\\nthe system’s dynamics over the specified time frame.\\nOnce the FPM is defined, it is vital to look at the overall structure\\nof the hybrid model as shown in Table 3. Step 1 starts by loading the\\nfermentation data into a DataFrame (DF) structure. This step ensures\\nthat all relevant data is organized and ready for preprocessing. The data\\nis then preprocessed to handle missing values, normalization, and other\\nnecessary cleaning tasks to prepare the data for model training in Step\\n2. In Step 3, the initial parameters required for the fermentation process\\nare initialized. These parameters include initial conditions and other\\nrelevant factors influencing fermentation. In Step 4, interpolation is\\nperformed on the data to obtain continuous values for process variables\\nsuch as RPM, pH, airflow rate, dissolved oxygen (DO), and O2. These\\ninterpolated values are crucial for the accurate modeling of the fermen-\\ntation process. After interpolating the data, target values for the model\\nTable 4\\nDNN integration into hybrid model.\\nStep Description/Code\\n1 Time_Input ← DEFINE_LAYER(shape=(1,),\\nname=‘time’)\\n2 Init_State_Vars ← DEFINE_LAYER(shape=(3,),\\nname=‘initial_variables’)\\n3 Inlet_Flow ← DEFINE_LAYER(shape=(1,),\\nname=‘inlet_flow’)\\n4 Merged_Layer ← CONCATENATE(DNN.output,\\nTime_Input, Init_State_Vars)\\n5 Integrated_Layer ← CUSTOM_LAYER(Merged_Layer,\\nfunction=custom_op)\\n6 Reactor_States_Output ← DEFINE_LAYER(shape=(3,),\\nactivation=‘relu’, name=‘reactor_states’,\\nnon_trainable=True)\\n7 Hybrid_Model ← ASSEMBLE_MODEL(inputs=[DNN.input,\\nTime_Input, Init_State_Vars],\\noutputs=[Reactor_States_Output])\\nparameters are set in Step 5. These targets guide the training process to\\nensure the model achieves the desired performance. The architecture\\nof the DNN is then defined in Step 6, specifying the layers, neurons,\\nactivation functions, and other architectural details. In Step 7, the DNN\\nis compiled and pre-trained using the preprocessed data. The inputs\\nfor this pre-training process typically consist of features derived from\\nthe system being modeled, such as process variables (e.g., temperature,\\npressure, concentration levels) or time-series process data for the states.\\nThe outputs correspond to the nominal parameters of the ODE that\\nneed to be optimized further during the hybrid model training. These\\nnominal values are from literature studies or process knowledge. This\\npre-training process involves optimizing the weights and biases of the\\nDNN to minimize the initial prediction error between the predicted\\noutputs and the actual target values from the training data. This step\\nhelps ensure that the ODEs do not suffer from ill-conditioning or\\nconvergence issues. In Step 8, the pre-trained DNN is integrated with\\nthe ODEs to form the hybrid model. The interaction between the DNN\\nand the ODEs is facilitated by passing certain parameters predicted by\\nthe DNN, such as reaction rates, yield coefficient, or other unknown\\nparameters (i.e., the parameter 𝑝), into the ODEs. These parameters,\\nwhich are difficult to model explicitly using FPMs, are refined by the\\nDNN based on the training data. Once these parameters are predicted\\nby the DNN, they are used within the ODEs to compute the evolution\\nof the system’s state variables over time. This iterative exchange allows\\nthe hybrid model to make more accurate predictions. In Step 9, the\\nhybrid model is compiled and trained to fine-tune the integration of\\nDNN and ODEs in a tandem manner. Finally, in Step 10, the trained\\nhybrid model is used to make predictions on the fermentation process,\\nproviding insights into the behavior and outcomes of the process under\\nvarious conditions.\\nIntegrating FPMs and DNNs begins by defining the input layer for\\nthe time variable as shown in Table 4. This layer is crucial for incorpo-\\nrating the temporal aspect of the fermentation process into the hybrid\\nmodel. Next, Step 2 defines the input layer for the initial state variables.\\nThese variables include initial conditions such as biomass, product,\\nand substrate concentrations. An input layer for the inlet flow is now\\ndefined in Step 3 to account for the flow rates into the system, which\\nis the manipulated variable. These input layers are then concatenated\\nwith the output of the pre-trained DNN in Step 4. This merged layer\\ncombines the strengths of the data-driven DNN and the physics-based\\nfirst-principles components. A custom layer function is applied to the\\nmerged layer in Step 5, allowing additional domain-specific knowledge\\nand empirical equations to be incorporated into the hybrid model. In\\nStep 6, the output layer for the reactor states is then defined with\\nnon-trainable parameters. This layer provides the final output of the\\nhybrid model, representing the states of the reactor. Finally, the hybrid\\nmodel is assembled using the defined input and output layers in Step 7.\\n\\x0cComputers and Chemical Engineering 194 (2025) 108926\\n10\\nP.

By presenting the code alongside\\nexplanations, we aim to support a broader audience in understanding\\nand adopting hybrid modeling techniques more effectively\\nStep 1 in constructing a hybrid model involves importing essential\\nlibraries. This includes ‘𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑝𝑦’ for numerical operations, ‘𝑝𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑎𝑠’ for\\ndata manipulation, ‘𝑠𝑐 𝑖𝑝𝑦.𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑔 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒.𝑠𝑜𝑙 𝑣𝑒_𝑖𝑣𝑝’ for solving initial value\\nproblems for systems of ODEs, and ‘𝑇 𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑜𝑟𝐹 𝑙 𝑜𝑤’ along with ‘𝑘𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑠’ for\\nbuilding and training deep learning models. Additionally, ‘𝑠𝑐 𝑖𝑘𝑖𝑡−𝑙 𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑛’\\nlibraries are used to preprocess and split the dataset. Step 2 involves\\nloading and preparing the dataset, which is critical for modeling.\\nThe data is loaded, and preprocessing steps are applied to normalize\\nfeatures and handle missing values. For example, features are normal-\\nized using ‘𝑆 𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑎𝑟𝑑 𝑆 𝑐 𝑎𝑙 𝑒𝑟’ to ensure a mean of zero and a standard\\ndeviation of one. The dataset is then split into training and testing sets\\nusing ‘𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛_𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡_𝑠𝑝𝑙 𝑖𝑡()’ to evaluate the model’s performance on unseen\\ndata.\\nIn Step 3, the FPM is defined using a function that describes the sys-\\ntem’s behavior through differential equations. In this example, a simple\\ndecay process is modeled, where the rate of change of the state variable\\nis proportional to its current value. The parameter 𝑘 is unknown and\\nwill later be estimated using a DNN. The process can be seamlessly\\nreplaced by any other process as long as the equation structure is\\nknown. A DNN is created to learn from the data and predict unknown\\nparameters for the FPM. The network is constructed using Keras, with\\nan input layer, multiple hidden layers with ReLU activation functions,\\nand an output layer with a linear activation function, as outlined in Step\\n4. The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer, which is known for\\nits efficiency in handling sparse gradients and adaptive learning rates.\\nDuring hybrid model training, the mean squared error (MSE) loss is\\nminimized. The MSE quantifies the difference between the predicted\\nand actual parameter values by averaging the squared differences,\\nhelping the model fine-tune its predictions for better accuracy. This\\nhelps the model minimize prediction errors during training, ensuring\\nthat the DNN closely approximates the unknown parameters to refine\\nthe FPM’s performance. Key structural hyperparameters — such as the\\nnumber of hidden layers, the number of neurons per layer, batch size,\\nand learning rate — are optimized using a combination of grid search,\\ncross-validation, and Keras Tuner, which automates the search for the\\nbest model architecture. Keras Tuner explores a wide range of hyper-\\nparameter values and selects the optimal set based on performance\\nmetrics like validation loss or MSE during training. The DNN is trained\\non the normalized features and target values with a specified batch size,\\nnumber of epochs, and a validation split to monitor its performance\\nduring training. An optional Step 5 can be added to train the DNN\\nseparately, providing insights into its performance before integrating it\\ninto the hybrid model. By using Keras Tuner, the model’s architecture is\\nfine-tuned to improve predictive accuracy while minimizing overfitting.\\nStep 6 involves integrating the DNN predictions into the FPM to\\ncreate a hybrid model. The DNN is used to predict unknown parameters\\nfor the FPM dynamically. In this example, the DNN predicts the param-\\neter 𝑘based on the current time and state variables. These predictions\\nare then used in the FPM to compute the rate of change of the state\\nvariables. Training the hybrid model involves solving the FPM using\\nthe parameters predicted by the DNN and adjusting the DNN based\\non the discrepancies between the predicted and actual trajectories, as\\nshown in Step 7. This process requires defining a training loop and\\nloss functions tailored to the specific application, ensuring the model\\nlearns to accurately predict the system’s behavior. Finally, the hybrid\\nmodel’s performance is evaluated on the test data in Step 8. This\\ninvolves comparing the predicted trajectories with actual trajectories\\nand computing error metrics to assess how well the model generalizes\\nto unseen data. The evaluation helps fine-tune the model and validate\\nits effectiveness in capturing the system’s dynamics.\\nRemark 2. One significant challenge in implementing hybrid models\\non platforms like TensorFlow is the suboptimal performance of built-\\nin ODE solvers when handling dynamic process models. For instance,\\nTensorFlow’s ODE solvers often struggle with stiff systems, requiring\\nsophisticated workarounds such as custom ODE solvers or integration\\nof external libraries like SciPy’s solvers to achieve efficient and accurate\\nsimulation of dynamic processes\\n4.

Through detailed case studies and\\nexamples, this section demonstrates the transformative impact of hy-\\nbrid modeling in improving predictive accuracy, optimizing control\\nstrategies, and enabling real-time adaptive monitoring across various\\nindustrial and scientific domains. The application of hybrid modeling\\ncan be divided into two parts: systems governed by ODEs and systems\\ngoverned by PDEs. Based on this, this section also discusses two case\\nstudies for both systems.\\n4.1. Adoption of hybrid modeling in engineering and science\\nHybrid models, which blend traditional FPMs with DDMs, are in-\\ncreasingly being adopted in various areas such as process modeling,\\nprocess control, process monitoring, model discovery, and plant scale-\\nup. In complex process modeling, hybrid models enhance predictive\\naccuracy and extrapolation by integrating mechanistic knowledge with\\nempirical data, allowing for the simulation of intricate chemical and\\nphysical processes, parameter estimation, and the capturing of nonlin-\\near system behaviors. In process control, hybrid models improve model\\npredictive control (MPC) frameworks, adapt to changing dynamics for\\nadaptive control, and ensure fault tolerance by detecting and com-\\npensating for system faults. For monitoring, hybrid models are crucial\\nin anomaly detection, state estimation, and predictive maintenance,\\nproviding accurate diagnostics and proactive maintenance strategies.\\nAdditionally, hybrid models facilitate model discovery and plant scale-\\nup by leveraging ML to identify underlying chemical mechanisms and\\noptimize the transition from pilot to industrial scale. Tables 5, 6, and\\n7 give a descriptive encapsulation of various challenges addressed by\\nhybrid models and the corresponding studies.\\n4.1.1. Process modeling\\nThis section delves into the integration of FPM and DDM in process\\nmodeling, highlighting the primary challenges in traditional modeling\\nthat hybrid models can address. Hybrid modeling approaches vary\\nwidely, employing structures from simple algebraic equations to com-\\nplex PDEs, enhancing predictive accuracy, operational efficiency, and\\ninterpretability across various industrial and plant-scale applications.\\nThese challenges include handling nonlinearities in complex dynamics,\\noptimizing process performance, estimating unmeasurable parameters,\\nand improving predictive accuracy with limited data. Moreover, hybrid\\nmodels enhance robustness and extrapolation capabilities, integrate\\nmultiple data sources seamlessly, reduce computational complexity,\\nand adapt to real-time changes effectively. In this section, we delve\\ninto these challenges in detail, illustrating how hybrid models provide\\nrobust, accurate, and efficient solutions for complex process modeling\\napplications.\\nA primary challenge that many real-world processes exhibit is\\nhighly nonlinear and complex behaviors that are difficult to capture\\naccurately with traditional FPMs and DDMs alone. These models often\\nfail to represent the intricate interactions and nonlinearities inherent in\\nsuch systems, leading to suboptimal performance and inaccuracies in\\npredictions. Hybrid models can effectively capture these nonlinearities\\nand complex dynamics as shown in Fig. 5. For instance, in reaction\\nengineering, series hybrid modeling frameworks have been used to\\ndetermine dissolution rates and dynamic concentrations of reactants by\\ntracking the nonlinear reaction kinetics of industrial reactors (Bhutani\\net al., 2006; Chen and Ierapetritou, 2020). This showcases the model’s\\nability to handle complex reaction systems with enhanced predictive\\ncapabilities (Simon et al., 2006; Zahedi et al., 2011).\\nTraditional optimization methods might not efficiently explore the\\nvast parameter space, especially in complex systems with numerous\\ninteracting variables. This inefficiency can lead to suboptimal solutions\\nand missed opportunities for process improvement.

By leveraging the strengths of both DDM and FPM, hybrid\\nmodels can explore the parameter space more comprehensively and\\nidentify optimal operating conditions more reliably. Many processes\\nhave parameters that are difficult to measure or estimate accurately,\\nleading to model inaccuracies and reduced reliability of the simulations\\nand predictions. Hybrid models can estimate latent parameters using\\noperating data, improving the accuracy of the models even when\\nsome parameters are poorly known. As an example, in systems with\\nvariations in operating conditions (Shah et al., 2022), feed quality, and\\nfermentation growth characteristics, hybrid models accurately predict\\nuncertain parameters such as heat and mass transfer coefficients and\\ntime-varying kinetic parameters (Azarpour et al., 2017; Xiong and\\n\\x0cComputers and Chemical Engineering 194 (2025) 108926\\n15\\nP. Shah et al.\\nFig. 5. Schematic for the use of hybrid models for process modeling.\\nJutan, 2002; Bellos et al., 2005). Furthermore, due to the complexity\\nof crystallization phenomena (Kwon et al., 2013), hybrid models have\\nbeen used to estimate the growth and nucleation rates. Specifically, re-\\nsearchers have used complex DDMs for growth rate predictions instead\\nof simple empirical expressions, which do not capture the complex\\ncrystal growth behaviors (Georgieva et al., 2003; Lima et al., 2023;\\nBishara and Li, 2023; Sitapure and Kwon, 2023c).\\nML models typically require large amounts of data for training,\\nwhich might not always be available, especially in industrial settings\\nwhere data collection can be costly or time-consuming. Hybrid models\\nrequire less training data while still enhancing predictive accuracy\\nby leveraging the underlying mechanistic models. For instance, the\\nhybrid model for viable cell concentration estimation in mammalian\\ncell cultivation combines FPMs and DDMs, effectively utilizing avail-\\nable data to improve predictions (Wu and Shi, 2007; Aehle et al.,\\n2010; Dors et al., 1995). This integration allows for accurate modeling\\neven with limited datasets, making hybrid models highly practical\\nfor various applications. Hybrid models also offer better extrapolation\\ncapabilities by embedding first-principles knowledge into the model\\nstructure. This is evident in the modeling of the enzymatic conversion\\nof penicillin G, where the hybrid model demonstrated good extrap-\\nolation properties (Van Can et al., 1999). By combining mechanistic\\ninsights with data-driven components, hybrid models can make reliable\\npredictions even in uncharted territories, enhancing their robustness\\nand applicability. Techniques, like intensified DoE (iDoE), have also\\nbeen integrated with series hybrid modeling to expedite experimental\\nprocesses and reduce costs, particularly at larger scales where exper-\\nimentation becomes increasingly expensive. The iDoE provides more\\nprocess response information in less overall process time, whereas\\nhybrid modeling serves to describe this behavior effectively. Combining\\nboth approaches is beneficial for faster design screening and is partic-\\nularly advantageous at larger scales, where costs per experiment rise\\nsignificantly (Bayer et al., 2020, 2021).\\nCombining various data sources and models to improve predictions\\nis complex and often leads to inconsistencies and integration chal-\\nlenges. Hybrid models can seamlessly integrate multiple data sources\\nand models, providing a unified framework for comprehensive anal-\\nysis. For example, hybrid hydroclimatic forecasting systems combine\\npredictions from dynamical, physics-based models with data-driven\\nmethods, resulting in more reliable and comprehensive forecasts (Slater\\net al., 2023; Richardson et al., 2020; Essenfelder et al., 2020; Bennett\\net al., 2016). This integration allows for better utilization of available\\ninformation and improves the overall accuracy and reliability of the\\npredictions.\\nAdapting models to changing process conditions in real-time is\\nchallenging with static FPMs, which are not designed to handle dy-\\nnamic changes and new data continuously. Hybrid models, particularly\\nthose integrating adaptive learning algorithms, can adjust to new data\\nand changing conditions in real-time. This adaptability is crucial for\\napplications like biomass gasification, where the hybrid model predicts\\ngas production rates under varying conditions (Guo et al., 2001).\\nOverall, hybrid modeling offers a powerful solution to the chal-\\nlenges faced by traditional FPMs and DDMs in process modeling. By\\nintegrating these two approaches, hybrid models effectively capture\\ncomplex dynamics, optimize performance, and improve predictive ac-\\ncuracy even with limited data. Their adaptability to real-time changes\\nand ability to integrate multiple data sources make them invaluable\\nacross various industrial applications. As these models evolve, they\\nwill play an increasingly vital role in advancing process efficiency and\\ninnovation.\\n4.1.2. Process monitoring\\nHybrid models have emerged as a powerful tool in addressing\\nthe multifaceted challenges associated with process monitoring. By\\nintegrating the robustness of FPM with the adaptability and predic-\\ntive power of ML techniques, hybrid models offer enhanced capa-\\nbilities for fault detection, state estimation, and handling complex,\\nhigh-dimensional data. These models excel in dynamic environments,\\nwhere they adapt to real-time changes and improve the accuracy\\nand reliability of predictions. Hybrid models reduce computational\\ndemands and can infer unmeasured states with minimal data, making\\nthem ideal for inferential monitoring and observer design.\\nHybrid models enhance traditional methodologies, such as the\\nKalman filter and moving horizon estimator (MHE), by incorporating\\ndata-driven components, thereby mitigating plant-model mismatches\\nand improving overall monitoring performance. These methods rely\\nheavily on accurate models to estimate states and correct predictions.\\nHowever, in real-world applications, plant-model mismatches often\\noccur due to unmodeled dynamics, external disturbances, or uncer-\\ntainties in system parameters. These mismatches can lead to degraded\\nperformance, inaccurate state estimations, and, ultimately, suboptimal\\nprocess monitoring. By integrating ML techniques into these traditional\\nframeworks, hybrid models can dynamically adapt to discrepancies\\nbetween the model and the actual process. For instance, in a hybrid\\nmodel-based Kalman filter, the data-driven component can adjust the\\nprocess noise covariance or directly influence the state update equa-\\ntions, making the filter more resilient to unexpected variations. This\\nintegration has been particularly effective in improving state estimation\\naccuracy, as demonstrated by hybrid model-based estimators, where\\nthe hybrid model is employed within the extended Kalman filter (EKF)\\nframework to improve predictive monitoring accuracy and control as\\nshown in Fig. 6. The combined hybrid-EKF approach yields superior\\nresults compared to traditional methods, such as partial least squares\\n(PLS) models, particularly in predictive monitoring and soft sensor\\napplications for titer estimation (Bai et al., 2023; Qi and Moore, 2002;\\nNarayanan et al., 2020). Similarly, in an MHE framework, hybrid mod-\\neling techniques can refine the objective function or improve constraint\\nhandling, leading to more accurate and robust state estimations even\\nunder significant plant-model mismatches (Xie et al., 2024; Li et al.,\\n2023; Ye et al., 2022; Sohlberg, 2007).\\nTraditional monitoring methods often struggle to capture the in-\\ntricate and deep process features essential for understanding system\\nbehaviors and detecting potential faults. They rely on simplified models\\nor direct analysis of high-dimensional data, which can miss intricate\\npatterns, nonlinear interactions, and subtle anomalies. These methods\\nmay also lack the adaptability to respond to dynamic changes in process\\nconditions, leading to reduced accuracy and reliability. Hybrid models\\noffer a robust solution to this challenge. By transforming complex,\\nhigh-dimensional process data into a lower-dimensional latent space,\\nhybrid models can more effectively extract and analyze the most critical\\nfeatures. This transformation enhances the model’s ability to manage\\ncomplex interactions, improves predictive accuracy, and reduces uncer-\\ntainty. For example, in the monitoring of cobalt removal within a zinc\\n\\x0cComputers and Chemical Engineering 194 (2025) 108926\\n16\\nP. Shah et al.\\nFig. 6. Schematic for using hybrid models for process monitoring using Kalman filters.\\nhydrometallurgy unit, hybrid models that combine a state-space model\\nwith deep learning have significantly improved accuracy (Sun et al.,\\n2020). More specifically, the hybrid model can focus on identifying\\npatterns, correlations, and anomalies that might not be apparent in the\\nraw, high-dimensional data. This approach allows the hybrid model to\\nconcentrate on key process features—such as reaction kinetics, energy\\ntransfer, or material interactions that are critical for accurate monitor-\\ning and control. By operating in the latent space, the DDM enhances the\\nmodel’s ability to respond to changes in process conditions, adapt to\\nnew data, and minimize uncertainties that could arise from incomplete\\nor imperfect knowledge of the system. This approach has also proven\\neffective in other complex processes, such as catalyst monitoring and\\nbiochemical reactions, where detailed feature extraction is crucial for\\naccurate monitoring and fault detection (Safavi et al., 1999; Pinto et al.,\\n2022; Bui et al., 2021).\\nMonitoring systems often face challenges when processing and an-\\nalyzing high-dimensional data, as it can be computationally intensive\\nand complex (Narasingam et al., 2023; Son et al., 2022b). Specifically,\\nthe data-driven component of a hybrid model addresses this by inte-\\ngrating dimension reduction techniques, such as PCA, with FPMs to\\nsimplify high-dimensional data without losing critical information. This\\napproach is particularly effective in applications like fault monitoring\\nof HVAC systems, where sensor data is condensed while preserving\\nessential features (Hassanpour et al., 2020).\\nBeyond managing high-dimensional data, another significant chal-\\nlenge in process monitoring is the need for models that can adapt to\\ndynamic changes in real-time. Static models, which are often used in\\ntraditional monitoring systems, may fail to adjust to changing process\\nconditions, leading to undetected faults or false alarms. In contrast,\\nhybrid models are designed to continuously learn from real-time data,\\nupdating their monitoring strategies accordingly. For example, a hybrid\\nmodel combining FPM and ANN has been shown to adapt effectively\\nto changes in bioprocess conditions, thereby improving monitoring\\naccuracy (Mahalec and Sanchez, 2012; Shah et al., 2023b).\\nHybrid models also offer significant advantages in early detection\\nand prognosis by combining their predictive capabilities with a deep\\nmechanistic understanding of the process. This integration allows hy-\\nbrid models to not only monitor but also anticipate potential faults,\\nas demonstrated in catalyst monitoring, where advanced algorithms\\nidentify issues before they can impact the process (Sun et al., 2020).\\nOverall, hybrid modeling approaches not only enhance the predic-\\ntive capabilities of traditional methods but also offer greater flexibility\\nand robustness, ensuring that process monitoring remains accurate and\\nreliable even under challenging conditions. This fusion of FPM and ML\\nthus resolves issues of plant-model mismatches by continuously learn-\\ning and adapting to the actual process dynamics, ultimately improv-\\ning overall monitoring performance and decision-making in complex\\nindustrial systems.\\n4.1.3. Process control\\nThe hybrid model’s ability to integrate the FPM with a DDM allows\\nit to address several key challenges in process control. This integration\\nresults in improved predictions over nominal FPMs, enhancing control\\nstrategies by managing nonlinearities, adapting to real-time changes,\\nand improving robustness against model uncertainties and external\\ndisturbances.\\nHybrid models significantly enhance predictive accuracy, address-\\ning the challenge of managing nonlinear and complex dynamic systems\\nin the context of process control. This is exemplified in the predictive\\ncontrol of jacket temperature, where hybrid models have been suc-\\ncessfully applied to track set-points of product conversion with greater\\nprecision (Vega et al., 1997). The improved predictive capabilities\\nof hybrid models facilitate the development of more robust control\\nstrategies that can adapt to real-time data and dynamic process condi-\\ntions. For instance, MPC implementations have benefited from hybrid\\nmodels in controlling monomer conversion and DO levels in sequencing\\nbatch reactors (SBR), resulting in enhanced process stability and effi-\\nciency (Cubillos et al., 2001; Azwar et al., 2006). Hybrid models has\\nalso been utilized for economic nonlinear model predictive control (eN-\\nMPC) to optimize the performance of an air separation unit (ASU) in the\\ncontext of fluctuating electricity prices, enabling the controller to make\\nefficient, real-time decisions by reducing computational complexity\\nwhile maintaining the accuracy required for dynamic process optimiza-\\ntion (Schäfer et al., 2019). Traditional ML models often require large\\ndatasets for effective training, a challenge in industrial settings where\\ndata may be sparse or expensive to obtain. Hybrid models mitigate\\nthis issue by incorporating first-principles knowledge, thereby reducing\\nthe data requirements while still improving control performance. An\\nexample is the hybrid model used for obtaining input profiles to control\\nparticle size distributions (PSDs), which demonstrates effective control\\nwith limited data (Doyle III et al., 2003). In addition to enhancing\\ncontrol accuracy, hybrid models also improve the robustness of control\\nsystems against uncertainties and external disturbances. By combining\\nthe theoretical rigor of mechanistic models with the adaptability of\\n\\x0cComputers and Chemical Engineering 194 (2025) 108926\\n17\\nP. Shah et al.\\nFig. 7. Schematic for the use of hybrid models for inverse process control.\\nmachine learning models, hybrid approaches offer a balanced solution\\nthat maintains control performance under varying conditions. This\\ndual capability makes hybrid models particularly valuable in industrial\\nprocess control, where maintaining robustness and reliability is crucial\\nfor optimal operation.\\nHybrid models have extensive applications in developing direct in-\\nverse control, addressing the challenge of determining optimal control\\ninput sequences in complex systems. In direct inverse control, a control\\nstrategy is developed where the control system directly computes the\\nnecessary input actions to achieve desired output setpoints by inverting\\nthe process model. The direct inverse controller uses the model to\\npredict the required inputs that will drive the system’s outputs to\\nmatch the target setpoints. The inverse calculation, when done using\\nhybrid models, benefits from improved accuracy due to the model’s\\nenhanced predictive capabilities. In the study by Ng and Hussain\\n(2004), researchers developed an inverse controller for a semi-batch\\nreactor by leveraging three NNs. These networks were employed to\\npredict uncertain parameters, refine the model’s residuals, and cor-\\nrect errors in the calculated input trajectories, thereby enhancing the\\ncontrol strategy’s overall accuracy. Similarly, Xiong and Jutan (2002)\\napplied a hybrid model for inverse calculations in controlling reactor\\ntemperatures within exothermic semi-batch reactors. This approach\\neffectively managed the nonlinear dynamics of the process, demonstrat-\\ning the robustness and adaptability of hybrid models in complex control\\nscenarios. It is important to note that in Fig. 7, which showcases the use\\nof hybrid models in the context of direct inverse control, 𝑞−1 and 𝑞−𝑘\\nare used to delay inputs to the NN Inverse Model. 𝑞−1 is a single time-\\nstep delay, and 𝑞−𝑘 is a more general form that represents a delay of 𝑘\\ntime steps. The inverse model uses these delayed inputs (past values of\\nthe process outputs and control inputs) to compute the control signal\\n𝑢(𝑘).\\nHybrid models are also applicable in internal model-based control\\n(IMC), where the FPM augmented with NN is used to take accurate\\npredictive control actions to track set-points of output trajectories.\\nThis addresses the challenge of enhancing predictive control accuracy\\nand robustness. Multiple studies have showcased how hybrid models\\nimprove IMC by integrating accurate predictive capabilities with first-\\nprinciples knowledge, thus providing better control performance and\\nadaptability (Vega et al., 1997; Aoyama and Venkatasubramanian,\\n1995).\\nIn recent strategies for batch-to-batch control, hybrid models are\\nused to obtain initial control strategies and refine models iteratively.\\nThis approach addresses the challenge of optimizing control strategies\\nwith limited data while improving model accuracy through continuous\\nlearning. Researchers have also highlighted how pre-trained hybrid\\nmodels provide initial control strategies, which are then refined using\\nnew experimental data (Ferreira et al., 2014; Doyle III et al., 2003).\\nThe iterative process continues until the model predictions align closely\\nwith experimental data, demonstrating the hybrid model’s ability to\\nadapt and improve over time. This was further illustrated in bioprocess\\ncontrol, showing how hybrid models can effectively refine control\\nstrategies through batch-to-batch learning (Teixeira et al., 2006).\\nRecent studies have increasingly implemented hybrid models to\\ndevelop model-based optimal control strategies. In this approach, a\\nnonlinear optimization problem is formulated using the hybrid model,\\nwhich is then solved to determine the optimal control trajectory (Ghosh\\net al., 2021; McKay et al., 2022; He et al., 2020). Hybrid models\\nare highly effective in capturing complex system behaviors, offering\\nenhanced predictive accuracy and adaptability. However, a key chal-\\nlenge with conventional hybrid models is their computational expense,\\nespecially when applied to real-time control scenarios. To address this,\\nresearchers have explored the use of physics-informed neural networks\\n(PINNs) for process control. Unlike traditional hybrid models that rely\\non integrating mechanistic and DDMs, PINNs directly embed physical\\nlaws into the NN architecture (Raissi et al., 2019). This allows PINNs\\nto solve differential equations governing the system dynamics while\\nsimultaneously learning from data. The result is a model that not only\\ncaptures system behaviors accurately but does so in a more computa-\\ntionally efficient manner. The computational efficiency of PINNs arises\\nfrom their ability to approximate complex dynamics without the need\\nfor extensive data-driven training, which can be time-consuming in\\nconventional hybrid models due to the presence of FPMs. Additionally,\\nPINNs can estimate model parameters from online data, allowing them\\nto adapt to changing conditions in real-time (Zheng and Wu, 2023;\\nAlhajeri et al., 2022a). This combination of efficiency and adaptability\\nmakes PINNs particularly well-suited for optimizing control strategies\\nin complex systems, addressing both the challenges of computational\\nload and the need for real-time responsiveness.\\nBy addressing these challenges, hybrid models offer robust, adap-\\ntive, and accurate solutions for process control applications, enhancing\\n\\x0cComputers and Chemical Engineering 194 (2025) 108926\\n18\\nP. Shah et al.\\noverall system performance and reliability. The integration of FPM and\\nNN in hybrid models enables them to manage complexities, adapt to\\nreal-time changes, and optimize control strategies effectively, making\\nthem invaluable tools in modern process control.\\n4.1.4. Model discovery\\nThe discovery of governing equations enhances dynamic systems’\\nforecasting, control, and analysis capabilities, which is critical in fields\\nlike neuroscience, cell biology, ecology, and epidemiology, where such\\nequations are often unknown. Despite abundant data, the lack of ex-\\nplicit analytic descriptions challenges traditional modeling approaches.\\nThis section explores the integration of hybrid modeling with deep\\nlearning to address these challenges, focusing on the discovery and\\napplication of PDEs.\\nHybrid models leverage ANNs to encode solutions to PDEs while\\nensuring adherence to fundamental physics laws. This approach is par-\\nticularly advantageous when data collection is prohibitively expensive\\nand traditional ML methods do not perform well due to insufficient\\nrobustness. The methodology relies on automatic differentiation, facil-\\nitating efficient derivative computation, which is critical for training\\nmodels that incorporate physics constraints. Raissi et al. (2017, 2019)\\npioneered this approach with PINNs, which optimize an objective func-\\ntion to minimize model prediction discrepancies and physics constraint\\nviolations. This dual focus ensures that models are not only data-driven\\nbut also grounded in physical reality, enhancing their applicability\\nand robustness. Recently, researchers have developed a methodology\\nfor using PINNs to handle plant-model mismatch, utilizing both first-\\nprinciples knowledge and plant data (Moayedi et al., 2024). The PINN\\nframework directly incorporates physical laws as constraints during\\ntraining, making it particularly suited for complex dynamic systems\\nwhere purely data-driven models such as DNNs or RNNs struggle with\\naccuracy. In contrast to our hybrid approach, which leverages data-\\ndriven models to correct unknown parameters in the FPM, PINNs\\nensure that the neural network adheres to the physical constraints of\\nthe system throughout the learning process. Improvement in the predic-\\ntive accuracy in plant-model mismatch scenarios indicates the potential\\nbenefits of employing such frameworks in systems with significant\\ndynamics or uncertainties.\\nRemark 3. Like hybrid models, PINNs aim to leverage both phys-\\nical laws and data-driven approaches to improve model accuracy.\\nThe key distinction lies in the way these models incorporate physical\\nknowledge: while hybrid models often combine separate components\\nlike FPMs and DDMs to correct or enhance predictions, PINNs embed\\nphysical constraints as part of the network’s architecture. By keeping\\nFPMs and DDMs separate, hybrid models allow clear interpretation and\\neasier integration with existing systems. This separation is especially\\nuseful when physical laws are well-understood, but certain parameters\\nneed data-driven correction. In contrast, it is harder to isolate and\\ndecouple the effects of physics-based knowledge in PINNs, limiting the\\ntransparency in certain applications. Hybrid models are also quicker to\\nadapt in industrial workflows, where existing FPMs can be used without\\nretraining an entire model. Thus, while PINNs provide a promising\\nalternative by enforcing physical constraints directly in the learning\\nprocess, hybrid models retain greater flexibility, modularity, and in-\\nterpretability, making them particularly suitable for scenarios where\\nboth physical laws and data-driven components are needed but should\\nremain distinct.\\nInnovative methods for learning PDEs from spatiotemporal data\\nhave been demonstrated in the literature. One such work is by Lagergren\\net al. (2020), who developed an ANN-based method to denoise data\\nand estimate partial derivatives accurately. Their approach, tested\\non models such as the advection-diffusion and Fisher–KPP equations,\\noutperformed traditional denoising techniques, proving highly effective\\nin identifying underlying PDE models. Additionally, hybrid models are\\nadvantageous in rooting for governing physics equations for a partic-\\nular process. We see such an approach in Patel et al. (2022), where\\nthey introduced a PINN tailored for discovering thermodynamically\\nconsistent equations, ensuring hyperbolicity in inverse problems related\\nto shock hydrodynamics.\\nThese advancements underscore the potential of hybrid modeling\\ncombined with deep learning in unveiling complex and previously ob-\\nscured dynamical systems, paving the way for significant contributions\\nacross various scientific domains.\\n4.1.5. Plant scale up\\nThe integration of FPM and DDM is valuable in scaling operations\\nfrom pilot plants to full-scale industrial units, a transition often fraught\\nwith challenges due to the change in scale and operating conditions.\\nScaling up poses significant challenges due to the emergence of dif-\\nferent dominant effects that may not be present at smaller scales. A\\nmodel developed at a pilot scale may lack the necessary detail and\\naccuracy when applied to a larger scale, as it must extrapolate beyond\\nthe operating and process conditions for which it was initially de-\\nsigned (Te Braake et al., 1998). Pilot plants are designed for flexibility\\nand controlled experimentation, often under idealized conditions. In\\ncontrast, commercial units operate under a broader range of conditions\\ninfluenced by economic, material, and logistical factors. This transition\\nis non-trivial due to several factors:\\n• Operational Variabilities: Larger-scale operations often deal with\\ngreater variability in input materials and environmental condi-\\ntions, significantly affecting process stability and output quality.\\n• Geometric and Kinetic Nonlinearities: Changes in scale can alter\\nthe fundamental behavior of the process. For example, heat trans-\\nfer and fluid dynamics do not scale linearly, affecting reaction\\nrates and mixing efficiency.\\n• Material and Energy Balances: The quantities of materials, energy\\ninputs, and outputs must be adjusted and optimized for larger\\nscales, which can introduce new constraints and efficiencies.\\nLarger-scale operations are often subject to greater variability in\\ninput materials and environmental conditions, which can significantly\\naffect process stability and output quality. Hybrid models address these\\noperational variabilities by incorporating flexibility in their structure,\\nallowing them to adapt to new data as it becomes available. The main\\nfeature of hybrid models that enables this is the ability to handle\\ntemporal parameter variability caused by changes in operation. This\\nadaptability is crucial for processes involving complex chemical reac-\\ntions or biological systems, where even slight changes in conditions\\ncan lead to significantly different outcomes. By dynamically updating\\nmodel parameters in real-time or near-real-time based on incoming\\ndata, hybrid models maintain high accuracy in predictions related\\nto yield, quality, and throughput, which is essential for operational\\noptimization and decision-making in industrial environments (Bellos\\net al., 2005).\\nChanges in scale can profoundly alter the fundamental behavior\\nof industrial processes, particularly in terms of geometric and kinetic\\nnonlinearities. As processes scale up, factors such as heat transfer and\\nfluid dynamics do not increase proportionally, leading to significant\\nimpacts on reaction rates, mixing efficiency, and overall process per-\\nformance. For instance, in larger systems, the surface area-to-volume\\nratio decreases, which can reduce the efficiency of heat dissipation and\\nalter flow patterns, thereby affecting the rates of chemical reactions\\nand the uniformity of mixing. These changes occur in a spatiotemporal\\ndomain, and the reaction rates and mixing parameters vary a lot in\\ndifferent regions of a system. Hybrid models are particularly effective\\nin addressing these scale-related challenges by combining FPMs with\\ndata-driven techniques. These models identify and correct discrepancies\\nthat arise when scaling up from laboratory or pilot-scale systems to\\ncommercial-scale operations. By integrating data from the commercial\\n\\x0cComputers and Chemical Engineering 194 (2025) 108926\\n19\\nP. Shah et al.\\nenvironment, hybrid models recalibrate critical parameters such as\\nreaction kinetics and flow dynamics, ensuring that predictions remain\\naccurate and reliable despite the complexities introduced by scale. In\\nthe fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) process, for example, hybrid models\\nare employed to maintain accuracy across different scales. As the\\nprocess scales up, the nonlinear effects of catalyst aging, feedstock\\nvariability, and changes in flow dynamics become more pronounced.\\nBy integrating mechanistic simulations of cracking reactions with NNs,\\nhybrid models can dynamically adjust to these scale-induced changes,\\nensuring that the process remains efficient and stable even at commer-\\ncial scales (Bollas et al., 2003; Michalopoulos et al., 2001; Acosta-López\\nand de Lasa, 2023).\\nAs processes scale up, the complexity of material and energy bal-\\nances increases significantly, primarily due to factors like imperfect\\nmixing and the spatially distributed behavior of large-scale systems.\\nIn commercial-scale operations, simple assumptions about uniformity\\nin temperature, concentration, and flow patterns that hold at smaller\\nscales no longer apply. Instead, these systems often exhibit complex\\nbehaviors governed by PDEs and computational fluid dynamics (CFD),\\nwhich account for the spatial distribution of variables and their interac-\\ntions (Nadal-Rey et al., 2021; Enfors et al., 2001; Bałdyga et al., 1997).\\nHybrid models are particularly well-suited to address these complexi-\\nties. By integrating fundamental principles, such as mass and energy\\nconservation laws, with empirical data from large-scale operations,\\nhybrid models can more accurately predict and optimize material and\\nenergy balances. These models consider the non-uniformity inherent in\\nlarge systems, enabling more precise adjustments to manipulated inputs\\nlike energy requirements, material flow rates, and reaction conditions.\\nThe main feature that allows the hybrid model to handle these complex-\\nities is its ability to capture the latent system behaviors and understand\\nhow changes in scale can affect the structure of the FPM and adapt\\naccordingly. Hybrid models can be used to predict spatiotemporally\\nvarying parameters even in complex PDEs with Courant–Friedrichs–\\nLewy (CFL) boundary conditions. For example, in large-scale reactors\\nor distillation columns, where imperfect mixing can lead to hot spots\\nor concentration gradients, hybrid models can predict these deviations\\nand adjust operating conditions accordingly to ensure uniformity and\\noptimal performance. By accurately modeling these spatial variations,\\nhybrid models help in forecasting key performance indicators (KPIs)\\nsuch as yield, purity, energy efficiency, and waste production, even\\nin the face of scaling challenges. Moreover, hybrid models enable\\nengineers to account for the additional constraints and complexities\\nthat emerge at larger scales, such as the increased difficulty of heat\\ntransfer, the need for more precise control over reaction kinetics,\\nand the potential for scaling-induced inefficiencies. This allows for\\nmore informed decisions about process adjustments, material inputs,\\nand operational conditions, ultimately leading to reduced costs and\\nenhanced efficiency in commercial-scale operations (Simon et al., 2006;\\nTe Braake et al., 1998). This ability to continuously adjust and optimize\\nprocesses makes hybrid modeling a vital tool for scale-up efforts across\\nvarious manufacturing and processing industries, ensuring efficient and\\ncost-effective transitions from pilot to full-scale operations.\\n4.2. Case studies\\nAs discussed throughout this review paper, hybrid modeling has\\nemerged as a powerful tool for addressing complex systems character-\\nized by the integration of DDMs with FPMs. However, its application\\nacross different fields encounters distinct challenges, which can be\\nbroadly categorized into four main areas: (1) capturing temporal varia-\\ntions in system dynamics, as demonstrated in crystallization processes,\\nwhere time-series-transformer (TST) models accurately predict growth\\nand nucleation kinetics; (2) managing uncertainties in kinetic parame-\\nters, as seen in fermentation processes, where hybrid models effectively\\npredict microorganism growth rates under varying conditions; (3) ad-\\ndressing the spatiotemporal variability in parameters, illustrated by\\nreaction–diffusion systems, where hybrid models handle complex dif-\\nfusion processes that vary over time and space; and (4) mitigating the\\neffects of parameter uncertainties in PDEs, such as those in hydraulic\\nfracturing, where hybrid models enable accurate predictions of fracture\\npropagation by learning temporal profiles of uncertain parameters.\\nEach of these applications highlights the capacity of hybrid models to\\nenhance prediction accuracy and system interpretability by effectively\\nresolving these challenges. Next, we will dive into each of these appli-\\ncations in detail and discuss how hybrid models can be used to address\\nthese four key challenges.\\n4.2.1. Application of hybrid models to crystallization\\nA critical example of applying the hybrid modeling methodology\\nto a system of ODEs is highlighted in the work by Sitapure and Kwon\\n(2023c). In this work, to tackle the challenges associated with capturing\\ncomplex parametric variation by various NNs in the hybrid modeling\\nframework, the NN is replaced with an advanced sequence-to-sequence\\nmodeling architecture, which is called TST (Wen et al., 2022). The\\ndeveloped framework was utilized to capture the temporal variation\\nin the crystallization kinetic parameters (i.e., growth and nucleation\\nrates). In this study, the authors also performed a rigorous analysis of\\nthe parallel and series approach for a hybrid model for applications to\\nthe case of crystallization. For demonstration purposes, the following\\nequations were utilized:\\n𝜕 𝑛(𝐿, 𝑡)\\n𝜕 𝑡 + 𝜕 𝐺(𝑇 , 𝐶𝑠)𝑛(𝐿, 𝑡)\\n𝜕 𝐿 =𝐵(𝑇 , 𝐶𝑠) (35)\\nwhere 𝑛(𝐿, 𝑡)is the number of crystals of size 𝐿at time 𝑡, 𝐵(𝑇 , 𝐶𝑠)is the\\ntotal nucleation rate, 𝐺(𝑇 , 𝐶𝑠)represents the crystal growth rate, and 𝐶𝑠\\nis the solute concentration at temperature 𝑇. The following equations\\nhighlight the temporal variation in the concentration and temperature\\nof the system:\\n𝑑 𝐶𝑠\\n𝑑 𝑡 = −3𝜌𝑐𝑘𝑣𝐺 𝜇2 (36)\\n𝑚𝐶𝑝\\n𝑑 𝑇\\n𝑑 𝑡 = −𝑈 𝐴(𝑇 −𝑇𝑗) − 3𝛥𝐻 𝜌𝑐𝑘𝑣𝐺 𝜇2 (37)\\nwhere 𝜇2 is the second moment of crystallization, 𝑘𝑣 is the shape factor,\\n𝜌𝑐 is the crystal density, 𝐶𝑝 is the heat capacity of the crystallization\\nslurry, 𝑚 is the total mass of slurry, 𝐴 is the total area between the\\njacket and reactor, 𝑈 is the heat transfer coefficient, and 𝛥𝐻 is the\\nheat of crystallization. In the equations above, uncertainties associated\\nwith 𝐺and 𝐵 (i.e., the crystal growth and nucleation rates) lead to un-\\navoidable plant-model mismatch. To address this mismatch, the parallel\\nhybrid model is used, which aims to eliminate the error by utilizing a\\nTST model to predict the temporal variation of the error between model\\npredictions and experimental results (Fig. 8). This method is preferred\\nwhen the FPM alone cannot capture all the dynamic variations in\\ncrystallization, offering a more flexible way to improve accuracy in\\nreal-time. In the case of the series hybrid model, a TST is utilized to\\npredict the uncertain parameters, i.e., 𝐺 and 𝐵, and then these param-\\neters are utilized in the FPM (Fig. 9). This approach is essential when\\nmaintaining the crystallization process’s interpretability is essential, as\\nit directly incorporates data-driven insights into the FPM (Sitapure and\\nKwon, 2023c). Utilizing TSTs in the hybrid modeling framework allows\\nit to handle long-term dependencies in data, which is a challenge in\\nprocess dynamics. When conventional DDMs like RNNs are utilized,\\nthey suffer from the challenges associated with vanishing gradients. In\\nthis case, utilizing the multiheaded attention mechanism to capture the\\ntemporal variation of the growth and nucleation rates alleviates this\\nissue (Sitapure and Kwon, 2023b,a). The training data in this work\\nwas obtained by randomly manipulating operating conditions under a\\nknown case of nucleation and growth rates. The performance metrics\\ninclude normalized MSE (NMSE) and the coefficient of determination\\n(𝑅2), with results showing values within the range of [10,50] × 10−4\\nfor NMSE and over 0.99 for 𝑅2, indicating high accuracy and relia-\\nbility. It is important to note that two architectures of TST models\\n(i.e., Base and Large) were considered, which vary based on several\\n\\x0cComputers and Chemical Engineering 194 (2025) 108926\\n20\\nP.

For context,\\nthe Base architecture has 2.5M parameters, 4 attention heads, and 2\\nencoder and decoder blocks, while the Large architecture has 6.5M\\nparameters, 8 attention heads, and 6 encoder and decoder blocks. The\\ntraining performance of the hybrid model is shown in Fig. 10.\\nThe corresponding evolution of the CSD with time is shown in\\nFig. 11. It is also clear from Fig. 11 that owing to the numerical\\ninstabilities of the parallel hybrid model, the CSD predicted by the\\nparallel hybrid model can have significant fluctuations as opposed to\\nthe smooth nature of the predictions from the series hybrid model.\\nThis is primarily because the parallel hybrid model tends to capture\\nthe discrepancy between the FPM prediction and the actual data by\\ncapturing the error values. In contrast, the series hybrid model allows\\nus to predict accurate values of the growth and nucleation kinetics,\\nultimately leading to smoother CSD predictions.\\nModel predictions under a varying set of operating conditions\\n(i.e., varying jacket temperature) were analyzed to observe the inter-\\npretability preserved by the series hybrid model. It was seen that the\\nvariation in the crystal growth and nucleation kinetics predicted by\\nthe hybrid model aligns closely with the actual values of the crystal\\ngrowth kinetics, as is shown in Fig. 12. Overall, the integration of\\nTSTs with traditional physics-based models represents a significant\\nadvancement in the field of process modeling, particularly for complex\\nsystems like batch crystallization. The hybrid models thus improved\\nprediction accuracy and enhanced the interpretability of the results.\\n4.2.2. Fermentation process\\nIn the study by Shah et al. (2022), the application of hybrid mod-\\neling to a complex fermentation process was shown. In this study,\\nthe primary motivation for utilizing a hybrid model was to capture\\nthe uncertainty associated with the kinetic parameters of the microor-\\nganism growth. The proposed hybrid model was able to address the\\nlongstanding challenge associated with accurately capturing the ki-\\nnetics of microorganism growth in a 100,000-gallon industrial-scale\\nfermentation process.\\nTo have a better understanding of the work done here, we first\\nhighlight some details of the kinetic model that was developed in this\\nwork:\\n𝜇= (𝜇𝑆1 +𝜇𝑆2 +𝜇𝐼)⋅\\n( 𝑋2\\n𝐾𝑋2 +𝑋2\\n)\\n(38)\\n𝜇𝑆1 =\\n𝜇𝑚𝑎𝑥,𝑆2 ⋅𝑆1\\n𝐾𝑆 ,𝑆1 +𝑆1 +𝑎𝑆1,𝑆2 ⋅𝑆2 +𝑎𝑆1,𝐼 ⋅𝐼 (39)\\n𝜇𝑆2 =\\n𝜇𝑚𝑎𝑥,𝑆2 ⋅𝑆2\\n𝐾𝑆 ,𝑆2 +𝑆2 +𝑎𝑆2,𝑆1 ⋅𝑆1 +𝑎𝑆2,𝐼 ⋅𝐼 (40)\\n𝜇𝐼 =\\n𝜇𝑚𝑎𝑥,𝐼 ⋅𝐼\\n𝐾𝑆 ,𝐼 +𝐼+𝑎𝐼 ⋅𝑆1 +𝑎𝐼 ,𝑆2 ⋅𝑆2\\n(41)\\n𝑑 𝑋2\\n𝑑 𝑡 =𝑘𝐿𝑎⋅(𝑋2𝑚𝑎𝑥 −𝑋2) −𝑞𝑋2 ⋅𝐵 (42)\\nwhere 𝜇, 𝜇𝑖, and 𝜇𝑚𝑎𝑥,𝑖 refer to the overall growth rate, the growth rates\\nassociated with each component (i.e., Substrate 1 (𝑆1), Substrate 2 (𝑆2),\\nand Intermediate (𝐼)), and the maximum specific growth rate of the\\nmicroorganism associated with each component respectively. 𝐾𝑠,𝑖 and\\n𝑎𝑖,𝑗 refer to the half-velocity constant associated with each component\\nand the inhibitory effect of component 𝑖on the utilization of component\\n𝑗 by the microorganisms. It is important to note that 𝑋2 is introduced\\nin the equation for the overall growth rate to incorporate the effect of\\nDO. Here, 𝑋2𝑚𝑎𝑥 is the maximum value of 𝑋2, 𝐾𝑋2 is the half-velocity\\nconstant associated with 𝑋2, 𝑘𝐿,𝑎 is the mass transfer coefficient, and\\n𝑞𝑋2 is the uptake rate of 𝑋2.\\nSubsequently, the fermentation model was built to have phases,\\nwith each phase indicating a different mode of operation and each of\\nthese phases having a different nutrition source.

The results\\nof the hybrid model highlight its excellent capability in capturing the\\ntemporal uncertainty with crucial model parameters that significantly\\nimprove the prediction accuracy of the FPM.\\n4.2.3. Application to hydraulic fracturing\\nHybrid models are also applied to the case of hydraulic fracturing\\nby Bangi and Kwon (2020). This application showcases the unique\\nability of the hybrid model to capture temporally varying parameters\\nin the system of PDEs. Hydraulic fracturing is a process in which\\nslick water with proppant is pumped inside a reservoir with very low\\npermeability at very high pressure to create high permeability fractures\\nthrough which hydrocarbons can flow from the reservoir into the\\nFig. 14.

(2022).\\nwellbore, thereby enhancing the amount of recoverable hydrocarbons\\nfrom the reservoir. Specifically, fracture propagation in this study was\\nmodeled using the Perkins–Kern–Nordgren (PKN) model described by\\nthe following equation:\\n𝜋 𝐻\\n4\\n𝜕 𝑊\\n𝜕 𝑡 − 𝜋 𝐸\\n128𝜇(1 −𝜈2)\\n(\\n3𝑊2\\n(\\n𝜕 𝑊\\n𝜕 𝑧\\n)2\\n+𝑊3𝜕2𝑊\\n𝜕 𝑧2\\n)\\n+𝐻 𝑈 = 0 (51)\\nwhere 𝐻 is the fracture height, 𝑊 is the fracture width, 𝜈 is the\\nPoisson’s ratio, 𝑈 is the leak off rate per unit height, 𝑡 is the time\\nelapsed, and 𝐸 is the Young’s modulus of the rock formation. The\\nboundary condition and the initial conditions needed to solve the\\nfracture propagation equation is mentioned as follows:\\n𝑞𝑧(0, 𝑡) =𝑄0 𝑊(𝐿(𝑡), 𝑡) = 0 (52)\\n𝑊(𝑧,0) = 0 (53)\\nwhere 𝑄0 is the fracturing fluid injection rate at the wellbore, and\\n𝐿(𝑡) is the fracture length varying with time. In solving the equation\\nmentioned above, uncertainty associated with the leak-off rate, 𝑈,\\nleads to significant limitations in the predictive capability of the first-\\nprinciples PKN model (Siddhamshetty et al., 2018). Understanding the\\nphysics associated with leak-off rate, it was proposed by Carter to be\\nvarying with time with the following empirical form:\\n𝑈 = 2𝐶𝑙 𝑒𝑎𝑘\\n√\\n𝑡−𝜏(𝑧)\\n(54)\\nwhere 𝑈 is the leak-off rate, 𝑡 is the associated time, and 𝐶𝑙 𝑒𝑎𝑘 is\\nthe leak-off rate.

To\\nobserve the effectiveness of the hybrid model, the PKN model with the\\nleak-off rate given by Eq. (54) was considered as the virtual experiment,\\nand it was also utilized for generating training data, with a value of\\n𝑄0 = 0.03 m3∕s.\\nThe fracture propagation results obtained from training the hybrid\\nmodel are presented in Fig. 16, with an RMSE of 0.0019 on the\\ntraining dataset. As depicted in Fig. 17, the hybrid model accurately\\ncaptures the leak-off rate profile, closely aligning with the theoretical\\nvalues given by Carter’s equation (Eq. (54)). To evaluate the model’s\\nperformance under new injection flow rates of 𝑄0 = 0.02 m3∕s, 𝑄0 =\\n0.04 m3∕s, and 𝑄0 = 0.05 m3∕s, the test RMSEs were found to be 0.1097,\\n0.0711, and 0.1225, respectively. To assess the model’s extrapolation\\ncapability, the fracture propagation predictions were compared with\\nvalues from virtual experiments and a purely DDM trained on similar\\ndata, as shown in Fig. 18. Despite being tested on previously un-\\nknown operating conditions, the hybrid model demonstrated superior\\nperformance, effectively handling discrepancies due to its integration\\nof first-principles. This study underscores the hybrid model’s robust\\nextrapolation capability and effectiveness in directly learning temporal\\nprofiles of key parameters from observed data, providing a strong\\nfoundation for predictive modeling in complex systems.\\n4.2.4. Application to reaction–diffusion system\\nIn the last example, the application of the hybrid modeling method-\\nology to capture temporal variation in uncertain parameters was ana-\\nlyzed. In the recent study by Pahari et al. (2024b,a), the application\\nFig. 18. Comparison of wellbore widths obtained from the hybrid model, DDM, and\\nactual values (Copyright 2020 Elsevier).\\nSource: Reprinted (adapted) with permission from Bangi and Kwon (2020).\\nof a hybrid modeling framework to the PDE governing the reaction–\\ndiffusion of cells in a growth medium was analyzed. The primary\\nchallenge addressed in this study involved capturing uncertainty in\\nmodel parameters that vary spatiotemporally. The equation covering\\nthe reaction–diffusion of cells is called the Fisher–KPP model and is\\ngiven by the following equation:\\n𝜕 𝐶\\n𝜕 𝑡 = ∇(𝐷∇𝐶) +𝜆𝐶\\n(\\n1 − 𝐶\\n𝐾\\n)\\n(55)\\nwhere 𝐶(𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑡)is the cell density that varies with space (𝑥, 𝑦) and with\\ntime 𝑡, 𝐷is the diffusivity of the system, 𝜆is the cell proliferation rate,\\nand 𝐾 is the cell capacity density. The boundary conditions needed to\\nsolve Eq. (55) are presented as follows:\\n𝜕 𝐶\\n𝜕 𝑥 = 0 𝑥= 0 (56)\\n𝜕 𝐶\\n𝜕 𝑥 = 0 𝑥=𝐿 (57)\\n𝜕 𝐶\\n𝜕 𝑦 = 0 𝑦= 0 (58)\\n𝜕 𝐶\\n𝜕 𝑦 = 0 𝑦=𝐿 (59)\\nwhere 𝐿is the length of the simulation domain. In the case of modeling\\nthe cell colony invasion and tumor growth, this work implemented\\na branched architecture of the hybrid model. This kind of Fisher–\\nKPP model with spatiotemporally varying diffusivity is often called\\nPorous-Fisher model. Due to spatiotemporally varying parameters like\\ndiffusivity, the nature of the solution for the PDEs changes. Further-\\nmore, parameters like 𝐾 and 𝜆 have only temporal variation and no\\nspatial variation. To address the challenges associated with simulta-\\nneously capturing both spatiotemporally varying parameters and tem-\\nporally varying parameters, this work implemented a branched archi-\\ntecture of the hybrid model. The branched architecture has CNNs and\\nCNNs/DNNs to extract spatial features and subsequently relate them\\nto spatiotemporally and temporally varying parameters. A detailed\\narchitecture for the branched hybrid model architecture is highlighted\\nin Fig. 19.\\nSince the machine-learning component of the hybrid model predicts\\nspatially varying parameters in every time-step, numerical stability in\\nthe solution to the reaction–diffusion system arises. To avoid this, the\\nCFL stability criterion had to be satisfied while training the hybrid\\nmodel. A comparison of the prediction of the hybrid model and FPM\\nprediction is highlighted in Fig. 20. The remarkable difference between\\nthe predictions of the FPM and the hybrid model is the presence of a\\nclear wavefront for cell density growth. This is primarily because the\\nFPM (i.e., the Fisher–KPP model) considers a constant diffusivity while\\nthe hybrid model captures spatiotemporal variation in the diffusivity.\\nThe comparison of the actual cell density and the cell density\\npredicted by the hybrid model aligns very closely.

The values of the parameters\\nlike 𝐾 and 𝜆predicted by the hybrid model align very closely with the\\nactual values, as shown in Fig. 22. Although, in practice, these values\\nare expected to be constant, the hybrid model keeps them to be time-\\nvarying. However, the temporal variation of these values is seen to be\\nvery low. This example highlights the capability of the hybrid model\\nto capture temporal and spatiotemporal variation in parameters.\\n5. Outlook\\nThe future of hybrid modeling is poised to address several critical\\nchallenges and opportunities, particularly in the context of rapidly\\nevolving computational capabilities and the increasing complexity of\\nsystems being modeled. As hybrid models continue to integrate diverse\\nsources of knowledge and data, several key research directions emerge\\nthat could significantly impact their development and application.\\n5.1. Adaptive hybrid models\\nOne of the most promising avenues for future research in hybrid\\nmodeling is the development of advanced methodologies that enable\\nthe dynamic adaptation and recalibration of sub-models within a hybrid\\nframework in response to changing process conditions. In complex\\nand evolving industrial environments, maintaining model accuracy and\\nrobustness is paramount, particularly for applications requiring real-\\ntime control and optimization.

Such methodologies would likely\\ninvolve the integration of online learning algorithms, real-time data\\nassimilation, and adaptive filtering techniques to ensure that hybrid\\nmodels remain accurate and reliable across varying process states.\\nFor example, in flexible pharmaceutical manufacturing, where process\\nadaptability is crucial, the ability to implement self-adjusting models\\nthat react to shifts in process parameters could significantly enhance\\nproduction efficiency and product quality (Gernaey and Gani, 2010;\\nGlassey et al., 2011). By advancing these adaptive hybrid modeling\\ntechniques, researchers can improve the reliability and applicability\\nof hybrid models in real-time industrial applications, thereby pushing\\nthe boundaries of what can be achieved in process optimization and\\ncontrol.\\n5.2. Multiscale hybrid modeling\\nHybrid models offer a powerful and flexible framework for ad-\\ndressing the unique challenges associated with processes that operate\\non multiple timescales, a common occurrence in many industrial and\\nbiochemical systems. These systems often exhibit both fast and slow\\ndynamics, making them difficult to model accurately and efficiently\\nusing traditional methods. By decoupling these dynamics and modeling\\nthem separately, hybrid models can significantly enhance both the\\nefficiency and accuracy of simulations. In systems where fast and\\nslow timescales coexist, stiff equations often arise. These equations\\nare challenging to solve because they require very small time steps to\\naccurately capture the fast dynamics, leading to high computational\\ncosts. However, by leveraging the strengths of hybrid modeling, it is\\npossible to separate the fast and slow dynamics into different modeling\\nframeworks. The FPM can be used to describe the slower, steady-state\\ndynamics of the system, such as thermal diffusion or long-term chem-\\nical equilibria. These models are based on well-established physical\\nlaws and can provide a solid foundation for understanding the under-\\nlying slow processes. On the other hand, DDMs are more suitable for\\n\\x0cComputers and Chemical Engineering 194 (2025) 108926\\n26\\nP. Shah et al.\\ncapturing fast, transient dynamics that mechanistic equations may not\\nfully understand or easily represent. These might include rapid reaction\\nkinetics, sudden fluctuations in process variables, or fast responses to\\ncontrol inputs. By using machine learning algorithms, particularly those\\ndesigned for time-series data, such as RNNs or transformers, DDMs\\ncan effectively learn and predict these fast dynamics from historical\\nand real-time data. By isolating the fast dynamics in a DDM, the\\nneed for excessively small time steps in the FPM is reduced, thereby\\nlowering computational demands. This separation also helps to mitigate\\nthe stiffness of the overall system, leading to more stable numerical\\nsimulations. The hybrid model can then couple the outputs of the\\nDDM (representing fast processes) with the FPM (representing slow\\nprocesses), ensuring that the interactions between fast and slow dy-\\nnamics are accurately captured without compromising computational\\nefficiency. Moreover, hybrid models can provide real-time insights into\\nboth aspects of biopharmaceutical manufacturing, where cell culture\\nprocesses involve fast metabolic reactions and slower growth phases.\\nThis enables more precise control over feeding strategies, enhancing\\nproduct yield and quality.\\n5.3. Integration with state-of-the-art ML models\\nHybrid models encounter significant challenges when applied to\\ncomputationally intensive systems such as CFD, molecular dynamics\\n(MD), dissipative particle dynamics (DPD), and kinetic monte carlo\\n(kMC) simulations (Golshan et al., 2020; Pahari et al., 2021a). This\\ncomplexity primarily stems from the difficulties in training these mod-\\nels directly from experimental data, which is often sparse or noisy.\\nHowever, recent advances in molecular simulations have demonstrated\\nthe substantial benefits of NN-based force fields, which have shown su-\\nperior accuracy in predicting interaction parameters between molecules\\ncompared to traditional parametric force fields. The integration of\\nadvanced deep learning architectures, such as transformers and mod-\\nels with attention and memory-based architectures (MAMBA), into\\nthese hybrid models, represents a significant leap forward in process\\nmodeling (Vaswani, 2017; Gu and Dao, 2023). These sophisticated\\nmodels excel at capturing long-range dependencies and complex inter-\\nactions within large datasets, making them particularly advantageous\\nfor chemical processes where traditional models may fall short. Tra-\\nditional hybrid models are prone to overfitting, particularly when\\ndealing with high-dimensional data, limiting their ability to generalize\\nto new, unseen scenarios. They find it challenging to integrate data\\nfrom multiple sources with varying fidelity levels, which complicates\\nthe training process and reduces model accuracy. Ensuring that these\\nmodels converge to a stable and accurate solution during training is\\ndifficult, especially as the model complexity increases. By leveraging\\nthese advanced DDMs, hybrid models can achieve more accurate and\\ndetailed predictions of complex properties, such as reaction kinetics\\nand material behaviors, under varying conditions (Ross et al., 2022;\\nChithrananda et al., 2020). This not only improves the precision of the\\nmodels but also enhances their generalizability and robustness across\\ndifferent operating conditions. To fully realize these benefits, future\\nresearch should focus on developing more generalizable and computa-\\ntionally efficient models by leveraging state-of-the-art ML techniques.\\nThese efforts will position hybrid models as essential tools for the future\\nof process modeling, enabling more accurate, adaptable, and robust\\nsimulations in computationally intensive applications.\\n5.4. Automatic determination of the hybrid model structure\\nOne of the critical challenges in hybrid modeling is the automatic\\ndetermination of the most appropriate model structure, especially in\\ncomplex systems with intricate dynamics (Schweidtmann et al., 2023).\\nTraditionally, this process has relied heavily on expert knowledge and\\ntrial-and-error, making it time-consuming and resource-intensive. How-\\never, recent advancements in optimization algorithms and machine\\nlearning are paving the way for more efficient and automated ap-\\nproaches. Techniques like mixed-integer programming (MIP) allow for\\nthe systematic exploration of potential model configurations by framing\\nthe selection of components as an optimization problem. This method\\nefficiently identifies the optimal combination of mechanistic and data-\\ndriven elements that best represent the system. These advancements\\nsignificantly reduce the time and expertise required to develop robust\\nhybrid models, facilitating their broader adoption across various indus-\\ntries. By automating the structure determination process, hybrid models\\nbecome more accessible and easier to implement, particularly in fields\\nlike pharmaceuticals, chemical engineering, and energy systems, where\\ncomplexity and data richness are prevalent.\\n5.5. Integration with uncertainty quantification techniques\\nUncertainty quantification is crucial for the reliable application\\nof hybrid models, especially in complex and high-stakes industries\\nlike pharmaceuticals, chemical engineering, and energy systems. As\\nhybrid models combine mechanistic and data-driven components, they\\nmust address both epistemic uncertainty (stemming from incomplete\\nknowledge or model structure) and aleatoric uncertainty (arising from\\ninherent variability in the system). Techniques such as Bayesian infer-\\nence and Monte Carlo methods offer robust frameworks for managing\\nthese uncertainties. Bayesian inference allows for the probabilistic up-\\ndating of model parameters as new data becomes available, integrating\\nprior knowledge with real-time information. Monte Carlo methods, on\\nthe other hand, provide a comprehensive understanding of potential\\noutcomes by simulating a range of scenarios based on probability\\ndistributions of input parameters, capturing the inherent variability in\\ncomplex systems. The integration of these uncertainty quantification\\ntechniques into hybrid models is essential for enhancing their accuracy\\nand reliability, particularly in real-time applications like digital twins\\nand smart manufacturing systems. Future research will likely focus on\\nimproving the scalability and precision of these methods, leveraging ad-\\nvancements in machine learning, such as Bayesian NNs and variational\\ninference, to handle the high-dimensional and nonlinear nature of hy-\\nbrid models. By refining these approaches, hybrid models can provide\\nmore actionable insights and maintain robust performance even in dy-\\nnamic environments, ultimately driving their broader adoption across\\nvarious industries where precise risk management and decision-making\\nare critical.\\n5.6. Development of software tools\\nThe development of software tools that enable the flexible inte-\\ngration of multiple knowledge sources into hybrid models is another\\ncritical area for future research. As hybrid models grow in complexity,\\nthe ability to seamlessly combine different types of data — ranging\\nfrom empirical measurements to theoretical models — will be essen-\\ntial for their practical application. These tools should be designed\\nto support the integration of diverse modeling approaches, such as\\ncombining mechanistic models with advanced data-driven techniques\\nlike transformers or deep reinforcement learning. Such tools would not\\nonly facilitate the development of more sophisticated hybrid models\\nbut also make these models more accessible to practitioners in various\\nindustries.\\n5.7. Real-world implementation\\nHybrid modeling has shown great promise in academic and lab\\nsettings, but real-world implementations bring unique challenges that\\nrequire specific techniques to ensure models work efficiently in dy-\\nnamic, data-intensive environments. One major hurdle is dealing with\\nincomplete, noisy, or sparse datasets, which can significantly affect\\nmodel performance. Techniques like data augmentation, filtering, and\\n\\x0cComputers and Chemical Engineering 194 (2025) 108926\\n27\\nP. Shah et al.\\nregularization are crucial for making data usable and preventing over-\\nfitting, especially when data is sparse. Scaling hybrid models for real-\\ntime applications or large datasets also presents computational chal-\\nlenges. Running complex simulations in real-time can demand signifi-\\ncant processing power, but leveraging distributed computing, GPU/TPU\\nacceleration, and model pruning can optimize performance without\\nsacrificing accuracy. As data dimensionality increases, managing mem-\\nory and resources becomes tricky in frameworks like TensorFlow or\\nPyTorch. Techniques such as batching, model compression, and sim-\\nplifying neural network architectures help reduce strain on memory\\nand improve scalability without compromising the model’s predictive\\npower.\\nOptimization strategies are critical for hybrid models in real-life\\napplications. Hyperparameter tuning, through methods like grid search\\nor Bayesian optimization, helps balance the FPM and DDM compo-\\nnents, avoiding overfitting while ensuring the FPM accurately captures\\nthe physical processes. For dynamic processes, solver performance is\\nanother challenge; using custom solvers or integrating more efficient\\nlibraries like SciPy in TensorFlow can overcome issues like solver\\nstiffness and poor convergence. Additionally, transfer learning can be a\\npowerful tool, allowing pre-trained models from similar systems to be\\nfine-tuned for new applications, reducing training time, and improving\\nperformance when data is limited. Together, these strategies can help\\nensure that hybrid models remain efficient and accurate across diverse\\nreal-world implementations.\\n6. Conclusion\\nThe future of hybrid modeling is exceptionally promising, with\\nabundant opportunities to advance the state of the art. Researchers can\\nfully unlock the potential of hybrid models by concentrating on the\\ninterpretation and adaptation of sub-models, refining methodologies\\nfor computationally intensive systems, and developing flexible tools\\nfor integrating diverse knowledge sources. These developments will\\nbe essential for creating more accurate, adaptable, and computation-\\nally efficient models across various applications, from pharmaceutical\\nmanufacturing to petrochemical industries to pulp and paper processes.\\nMoreover, advancements in machine learning, particularly in real-time\\nlearning and online updating algorithms, will significantly enhance\\nhybrid models’ ability to adapt to changing process conditions. The\\ncontinued integration of hybrid models into digital twins and smart\\nmanufacturing systems is poised to drive the next generation of indus-\\ntrial automation, where real-time optimization and control are crucial.\\nThe rapid growth in computing power over the coming years will\\nplay a pivotal role in this evolution, enabling more sophisticated and\\nresponsive hybrid models that meet the demands of modern industry.\\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\\nParth Shah: Writing – review & editing, Writing – original draft,\\nVisualization, Validation, Supervision, Software, Resources, Methodol-\\nogy, Investigation, Formal analysis, Data curation, Conceptualization.\\nSilabrata Pahari: Writing – original draft, Software, Project admin-\\nistration, Methodology, Investigation, Data curation, Conceptualiza-\\ntion.
